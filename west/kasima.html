She walked pass Ngozi and Nkechiyere as her slippers were making sound on the ground and taking duty. Ngosi and Nkechi stopped walking and faced each other.
                "Did she just pass us without greeting us?" Nkechi asked.
                "Don't mind her, how will she greet? Is she not an Illiterate? Her mother didn't teach her how to greet her elders." Ngosi said while kasima stopped walking and looked back at them because she heard what they said, her eyes became red, her mouth and face were poping and her breathing became high, she smiled angrily and continue walking because her firewood was heaving her.
                ("So Ngosi and Nkechi is referring to me? Okay no problem I is coming back for they.") She thought as she continue walking.
                "Did she just starred at us with those witch eyes of hers?" Ngosi asked.
                "Please don't mind her, she is not in the same class with us, let's go and fetch our water." Nkechi said as they start walking to the scraem.
                Kasima got home and throwed the firewood from her head to the ground and the cutlass as her mother came out of the wood kitchen that was builded in their backyard. Her mother saw the expression on her face Which says she was not happy as she turned back and start walking away in a hurry.
                "Kasima, where are you going?" Her mother asked following her but she didn't replied nor looked back, she just kept walking very fast.
                "Amaka! Amaka!" Kasima's mother called.
                "Mama!" Amaka answered and came out of the house.
                "Amaka, your sister just came back from the bush with firewood, she dropped them and ran out with the expression on her face tells that something is wrong." Said her mother.
                "Hmm, I think someone has offended her again or called her an Illiterate." Amaka said.
                "I think so too but you must hurry up now and meet her so that she won't do something stupid, you know what your sister is capable of doing." Her mother said.
                "Yes mama but which direction did she followed?" Amaka asked.
                "She followed this road." Her mother said pointing at the road opposite their house by the left.
                "Okay mama, you go inside I will be back." Amaka said walking away.
                Please don't allow your sister to do anything tragedy to someone's child oh bikonu." Her mother said in a worried tone.

            Mrs Godwin could be see sitting on the sofe at the living room reading news paper alongside with her daughter Cindy, wisdom's twin sister when wisdom walked in with a briefcase in his hand, he was obviously returning from work.
"Good evening mum, hey kid sister Wat's up?" He said as he walked fully into the living room.
"Welcome son." Mrs Godwin said.
"Thanks mum." Wisdom replied.
"I am not a baby oh, we are twins you should know that." Cindy said jokely.
"That doesn't change the fact that I am still a man and the head." Wisdom said sitting beside her.
"Look at your head, you are a man? So if they say men should come out, so you will also come out?" Cindy asked jokely while they laughed including their mother.
"Off course he is a man." Mr Godwin said from the stairs as he slowly walked down while they all turned their eyes to his direction.
"Dad, please tell her for me." Wisdom said and they laughed again.
"Bring yourself here." Cindy said and hugged wisdom.
"How was your day?" She asked feeling concerns.
"It was stressful as always." Wisdom said like a baby in his sister's arms.
"I know you must be very hungry, I have prepared your meal." Cindy said releasing him from her arms.
"Oh sweet sister, this is why I love you." He said happily and kissed her cheeks.
"Now go inside, take your shower and come back for your food." Cindy said.
"Yes ma." Wisdom replied and was about going upstairs when his mother's voice stopped him.
"Wisdom, Sophia was here today." Said Mrs Godwin.
"And?" Wisdom asked not facing his mother.
"And she complained bitterly that you have not been calling her and you don't even picked her calls or reply her messages, why it's so?" Mrs Godwin asked.
"Because I have no business with her." Wisdom replied still not facing his mother.
"Wisdom, I want grandchildren, I want you to get married." Mrs Godwin said.
"Mum please, I will get married when the time comes." Wisdom said facing his mother.
"Wisdom when?" Mrs Godwin asked.
"When I find the woman that suit my heart I will marry and give you and dad as many grandchildren as you both want but for now no." Wisdom said.
"What kind of woman do you want when Sophia is there? She has everything you need in a woman." Mrs Godwin said.
"Mum sorry to ask, what exactly do you have in common with this Sophia of a girl?" Wisdom asked.
"Good question, Sophia is beautiful, intertelligent, responsible and she came from a very important and wealthy family and I know that she will make a very good wife to you." Mrs Godwin said smiling.
"Umm I see, mum can you define the word RESPONSIBLE? Do you know the meaning of a responsible lady? Well if you don't know, let me tell you, a responsible lady is a lady that respect herself and others, a lady that is humble, a responsible lady is a lady that doesn't look down on others. I don't want to marry a lady that cannot cook, clean or wash her underwear, I cannot marry an arrogant woman that does not have respect. I want to marry a RESPONSIBLE woman with a good heart." Wisdom said.
"Why will she cook and clean when there is maid in the house." Mrs Godwin said.
"Oh I can see that you are after wealth and status but unfortunately I can't please anybody and displease myself." Wisdom said and turned to his father.
"Dad, did you heard what your wife said?" He asked.
"Son, like I always told you, you are a grow up man and an adult so you have the right to choose the kind of woman you want to marry but choose wisely cause whoever you bought home as your wife, I shall bless the both of you." Mr Godwin said.
"Thanks dad." Wisdom said and turned to Mrs Godwin.
"Mum, what dad just said is true, wisdom is an adult for Christ sake and he has every right to choose the woman of his choice." Cindy who has be standing there listening to everything finally spoke.
"Will you shot up your mouth!? Your mates are in their husband's house and you are here interferring in your brother's issue mitcheeew!!
Wisdom must marry whoever I choose for him and Sophia is the one I choose for him." Mrs Godwin said.
"Then we shall see!!" Wisdom said and eyed her before walking to the stairs, Cindy and Mr Godwin also eyed her before they left the living room.
("Hmmm, wisdom is just too stubborn like his late mother, he has grow winds to talk back at me, he want to ruined my plains but I won't let it happen. He must marry Sophia dead or alive, hmmm anyway I know what to do.") Mrs Godwin thought to herself and took her phone from the glass stool beside the sofe she was sitting.

"Igew she is here." One of the guard said while king Maduka nod his head in respond. Kasima looked everywhere her eyes met with Ngosi and Nkechi eyes, they eyed her and hissed shaking their legs like the trouble makers they are. Then kasima understand why she was dragged there like a common their when she was not.
"Do you have to be reminded before you greet?" King Maduka asked while kasima starred at him with hatred, she wish she could kill him instantly, she turned to Ngosi and Nkechi and to the prince.
"You is not sending for me, you is telling your guards to drag me here so I is not greeting you." Kasima said boldly.
"What?" Prince Ikena shouted standing up from his seat when kasima's mother and sister ran in.
"Did you just talk to my father the king in such manner?" Prince Ikena yelled at kasima.
"If your father is wanting me to greet him, then he is sending for me and I is coming here and greeting him." Kasima said looking at the prince in the eyes.
"How dare you!?" Prince Ikena asked and slapped KASIMA, she raised her hand to slap the prince back but her mother held her hands that was when she realised that her mother and sister were at the throne room.
The king and everybody were surprised, Ngosi and Nkechi were shocked of kasima's boldness. King Maduka stood up from his seat as kasima's mother and sister went down on their knees.
"Igwe please have mercy on my daughter." Kasima's mother pleaded.

"Don't mind him, if they were your daughters that kasima beat up this way I know you won't take it likely with her." Onowu said.
"Onowu, kasima cannot beat my daughter when she didn't do anything to her, I strongly believe that Ngosi and Nkechi did something wrong to her that was why she beat them." Mazi Okoro said.
"Exactly your majesty, you are been too harsh on her, you should at least allow her to talk before jumping into conclusion and......"
"Shut your mouth up! How dare you say that before me? Before the end of this meeting I don't want to hear a word from you and Okoro." King Maduka interrupted Mazi Dike.
"Am sorry your highness." Mazi Dike said with a low tone.

"Take kasima to the palace cell and make sure nobody gives her food till her mother treat Ngosi and Nkechi." He said.
"Your will is our command." The guards said and dragged kasima out of the throne room as her mother and sister were begging king Maduka.
"Get out of here and treat this two girls before I increase the punishment!" King Maduka said angrily while kasima's mother and sister went out of the throne room. They were going to the gate when they met queen mercy and princess Adaeze going to the palace, they stopped and greeted them.

#AT_AJIMA_LAND

King Maduka walked out of his throne room, he could be see standing in the palace compound, he looked around and smiled to himself.
("I can't affrot to lose this throne and respect that I get from people and I guess Kasima hasn't find out that the throne belongs to her father. Well nothing to be scared about if she finds out, I will use my power as the king to either banish her or kill her and her family Because she seems to be fearless and bold, she is actually the first person that have boldly talked to me in my face. Well I will let her go because I know Nkechi and Ngozi insulted her, so I will wait till she falls into my trap again and I will use the opportunity to kill her and her family before she will found out the truth, yes that's what I will do") He said to himself in thought and turned back.
"Hey come here!" He said to the guard that was standing in few km away from him, the guard hurrily went to him.
"Your majesty." The guard said with his head and knees down.
"Go and release that girl called kasima, make sure you beat her up till her skin becomes red before you let her go understood?" He said in a commanding tone.
"Yes my king." The guard replied with his head still down.
"Good, go with another guard with you." He said.
"Okay my king." The guard replied and left immediately, he took another with him as instructed by king Maduka to the palace cell. They dragged the already weak kasima out like a goat and lied her to a tree while they flogged her with no mercy as she kept screaming.
They kept flogging her till her fair skin began to red.
"Hey enough! You guys have beaten her enough or do you want her to die?" The guard that was standing at the palace cell door named Emeka said.
"The king asked us to beat her till her body becomes red." Ejike the guard that was beating kasima said .
"So because the king said so, that mean you will beat her till she died? Or can't you see that she is already too weak? Don't you have conscience?" Emeka asked.
"Alright, let's take her to the king." The other guard said while they loose kasima and dragged her to king Maduka leaving Emeka alone.
"Your highness." They said and bow their heads as they dropped kasima on the ground.
"Uuummmmm!!!" King Maduka groan like a hungry lion.
"Why....you....is..is..(coughing)..you....is.. doing this to me? What me is doing.......to ...you?" Kasima asked weakly.
"Guards throw her out of my palace." King Maduka commanded while the guards dragged kasima out and left her on the ground outside the palace. She managed to stay up and start walking little little but was staggering backward, she managed to walked 9 miles away from the palace before she fell on the ground, close to the road that leads to Amanlinda's river, she was unable to stand up due to the pain and weakness. Ogechi and her brother Obinna were coming back from farm when they saw kasima lying down.
"Jesus! What is kasima doing on the ground? What happened to her?" Ogechi asked pityfully.
"Haven't you heard?" Obinna asked.
"Heard what?" Ogechi asked too turning to him.

            "Haven't you heard?" Obinna asked.
"Heard what?" Ogechi asked too turning to him.
Obinna looked around to be sure that nobody sees or hears him before he moved closer to Ogechi.
"I heard that kasima beat up Ngozi and Nkechi and they went to report to king Maduka and he ordered his guards to locked kasima in the palace cell for three days without food or water." He said almost whispering.
"But why will the king do that without asking what happened?" Ogechi asked.
"Hmm, I heard she refused to great and also insulted him." Obinna said.
"Hmm, nawo... please let's help her, I know that her poor mother must be very worried now." Ogechi said.
"Yes you are right...hold this cutlass let me carry her." Obinna said and handed the cutlass to her while he carried kasima, they took her to her father's house.
They got to her house and knocked.
"Who is here." Ogechi said.
"Who is that?" Kasima's mother asked and came out of the house.
"Mama good afternoon, we bought your.....". Ogechi was cut short.
"Ewo! My daughter....Amaka bring may be fast, your sister is back" she said rushing to them.
Moments later, kasima was lying on the mat and her mother was massaging her body with hot water.
" Where did you find my sister?" Amaka asked.
"We found her at the road that leads to Amanlinda's river." Ogechi said.
"Thank you very much." Kasima's mother said.
"Mama is nothing." Ogechi said.
"Erm....mama we have to be on our way now, our mother will be waiting for us." Obinna said standing up.
"Exactly, we will come back to check on her." Ogechi said standing up too.
"No problem my children go well." Kasima's mother said.
"Thank you once again." Amaka said while they nod and left.
"Amaka please go and call nurse Blessing, so that she can treat your sister." Kasima's mother said.
"But mama we don't have any money, will she treat her like that?" Amaka said calmly.
"Don't worry my child, I have N3000 with me, I will give it to her and beg her to treat her." Her mother said.
"But what if she refused?" Amaka asked..
"Don't worry about that just go and call her." Her mother said.
"Okay if you say so." Amaka said before she left.
25 minutes later, she came back with nurse Blessing.. she treated kasima and gave her some drugs and also didn't collect money from them..

#BACK_TO_THE_CITY
**
Cindy came down from the stairs, she met Mrs Godwin and Sophia watching TV..she walked pass them and went to the kitchen, she tries to open the kitchen door but it was locked... She kept the food Sophia had left in wisdom's room on the dinning table and went back to the living room.
"Mum, who locked the kitchen?" She asked.
"I did, do you have a problem with that?" Mrs Godwin asked in a harsh manner.
"Mum please can I have the keys? I need to prepare food for wisdom, dad and myself."
"Cindy, the kitchen will be opened if you and wisdom eat the food Sophia cooked." Mrs Godwin said.
"We can't eat Sophia's food". Cindy said.
"Then you two are not hungry." Mrs Godwin said.
"Mum, how do you except us to eat the food that someone we don't like and need around us cooked? Tell me how do you expect us to do that?" Cindy asked.
"Then sleep hungry!" Mrs Godwin said.
"I wonder if you want to marry your brother, your mates are in their husbands house with their kids, you are here fighting for food." Sophia said and hissed.
"Don't you dare insult me, this is my father's house and I have the right to......"
"Oh shut your mouth! Your father's house? If you know that you and your brother will not eat the food Sophia cooked then go in there and sleep hunger and stop disturbing us.... As you can see we are watching movie." Mrs Godwin said yelling.
Cindy was dumfounded, she couldn't say a word....she walked slowly to the stairs and looked back. (" Is she truly our mother? Why is she treating us this way?") She thought sliently as tears dropped from her eyes. She cleaned her tears and went to wisdom's room, she opened the door and walked in slowly with some tears in her eyes. Wisdom rushed to her and held her hands.
"Sis, I heard mum's voice and I was coming downstairs to know what was happening." Wisdom said..
"Mum locked the kitchen and I requested for the key but she refused to give me, she said we should sleep hungry if we don't eat the food that Sophia cooked." Cindy said sadly.
"Why is mum doing this to us? Do you think this woman is truly our mother?" Wisdom asked.
"That's the question I have been asking myself." Cindy said.
"Is okay, come have your seat." Wisdom said taking her hand..she followed him and they sat on the bed.
"Sis, let's wait for dad to return meanwhile, eat this." Wisdom said handing over the remaining gala from the ones Cindy had gave him.
"Don't worry I will be fine, just eat okay?" Cindy said.
"No, we are in this together, so eat..you can't stay hungry." Wisdom said......she breathed down heavy before collecting the gala.
"I am just wondering if this woman is our mother." Cindy said.
"Me too, the way she treats us and the way she is so desperate about me marrying Sophia is just confusing, I can't just understand it." Wisdom said.
"You are right, I think we should talk to dad about this." Cindy suggested.
"Dad that don't has time for us, all he do is to travel from one country to another." Wisdom said moodly.
"Come on brother, you and I know that we are grow ups...we are 24 already, so you don't expect dad to be staying with us when he knows that we can take care of ourselves." Cindy said.
"You are right but at least he should spend little of his time with us." Wisdom said.
"Is alright, we will talk about that when dad returns back." She said and smiled.
"Okay ma'am." He replied smiling too...

            TWO WEEKS LATER, AT AJIMA LAND.
**
Kasima has already healed from all the wounds in her body, her mother didn't allowed her to go out or do anything for two weeks.
One Thursday evening after eating, kasima's mother called her and Amaka.
"Mama you called us." Amaka said.
"Yes my children, please sit down." Their mother said while they sat down beside her.
"My children please becareful of king Maduka, especially you kasima, I don't want what happened 15 years ago to repeat itself again." Said their mother.
"Mama, what happened 15 years ago?" Amaka asked.
"I don't want to remember it and I don't want to talk about it, I just want you girls to stay away from king Maduka because that man is very wicked and dangerous." Said their mother.
"But mama, why it's that each time we ask you about what happened 15 years ago, you will always say you don't want to talk about it why?" Amaka asked.
"I have my reasons, there are somethings that are better left untold." Said their mother.
"For how long will you keep this thing untold? Mama how long?" Amaka asked standing from the bench they were sitting.
"Mama, today you is telling us what happened 15 years ago, me is wanting to hear it na na." Kasima who has be quite said as she also stood up the bench. Their mother was completely speachless, she sat mutely not knowing what to say.
("Should I tell them the truth?") She asked herself in thought. ("How long will you keep the cat in the bag? Let the cat out of the bag so they will know who they truly are.") A voice said to her in her thought.
"Mama we are waiting." Amaka said making her to jumped out from her thoughts. She looked at them and smiled.
"Sit down my children, let me tell you the story." She said calmly while they sat down.
"15 years ago, when kasima was four years and you Amaka was just two years old... King Okaka the former king before king Maduka died without a heir to the throne, accord to the tradition..when a king dies without a heir to his throne, the throne will automatically moved to the next family in line and any male child in that family will becomes the king.
So after king Okaka died, the next family in line was our family and your late father was supposed to rule as a king in this kingdom but king Maduka disagree to it, simply because the late Igwe Okaka was his brother so he requested to becomes king. Your father, late onowu Udemba and some elders disagreed with him that your father must be crowned king..... King Maduka paid some boys to murdered your father and onowu Udemba in cold blood. A month later after your father and onowu Udemba were buried, king Maduka was crowned king by the present onowu and Mazi Ejiofor. Then the staff of authority that makes one a king gone missing...
King Maduka gave orders that all the whole house in this village should be searched and the guards found the staffs it in Mr Godwin's who happens to be late onowu udemba's younger brother and was banished from this kingdom for life with his family... That was how your father and onowu Udemba was killed and his brother was banished till today nobody knows where Godwin is, if he and his family are alive or dead. According to the former priest in sanit Martin's Catholic church said that the staff of authority king Maduka is using is fake and that the banishment of Godwin and his family was planned because of some reasons that will be know to the people at the right time...
That was how it all happened, since then we have been living in darkness and fear in this kingdom. ... He requested sleeping with me and I refused so he took your father's lands leaving only the one at umuake road, when I confronted him, he threaten to kill me if I ever talked about the lands.
So my children please stay away from him I don't want anything to happen to the both of you, you two are the only family I have". Their mother said.
"Hmmm, m'ama, how come you kept all this from us your children all this year's?" Amaka asked.
" I am sorry my children, I never wanted to hurt you girls." Their mother said.
"But mama, you should have told us." Amaka said.
"I am sorry my children." Said their mother.
The already angryed kasima stood up from the bench, her eyes were already red, she was breathing heavily.
"King Maduka killing my father." She said under her breathe and turned to her mother and sister.
"I is fighting king Maduka " she said and ran out of the house.
"Kasima! Come back here! Where are you going? Oh God what kind of trouble is this again?" Their mother lamented.
"Mama is okay, kasima will come back." Amaka said.
"Your sister is going to confront King Maduka and you know what that means." Said their mother tearsfully.
"Mama I know but king Maduka will not harm Kasima." Amaka said.
"What are you saying Amaka? Two weeks ago he almost killed her and here you are saying he won't harmed her." Their mother said sadly.
"Mama, u believe that the God Almighty we are serving will not let us down...just calm down okay?" Amaka encouraged her and she nod..

Meanwhile, king Maduka was having meeting with his family in his living room..... Princess Adaeze walked in slowly.
"Greetings father, greetings my queen." She greeted with her knees almost down.
"Where is your mother?" King Maduka asked, queen Diana did not answer princess Adaeze's greeting, she just eyed her and turned her face but who cares.
"She is coming." Princess Adaeze said before sitting down on the couch just then kasima rushed in with a guard shouting at her that she can't enter the palace. They got to the living room where king Maduka and his family were.
"Your highness, I tired stopping her but she refused." The guard said with his head down.
"Is okay, you can go now." Said king Maduka while the guard left and he turned to the already deadly Kasima.
"And what is the meaning of this you daughter of a nobody? What do you......"
"It you is a nobody! You is killing my father and taking the throne!' kasima interrupted him yelling.. for the first time, king Maduka was scared. The princesses, prince and queen Diana were shocked.
"Will you shot your mou....."
"No you is shoting your mouth up!" Kasima interrupted queen Diana and turned to King Maduka.
"You killing my father and onowu Udemba because of the throne, you is going to pay." She said angrily..
"How dare you talk to my father the king of all kings in such manner!!" Prince Ikena yelled.
"Shoting your mouth up mama's boy." Said kasima.
"Are you mad!?" The prince said and slapped her.... KASIMA closed her eyes for about 45 seconds before she opened them, her eyes became more red and scaring. The prince make an attempt to sit down when he received double slaps on his cheeks which makes he to fell on the couch.... kasima had just slapped him. She walked closer to the king.
"You evil king, you is killing my father and taking the throne and our lands why? What we is doing to you?" Kasima asked with pain in her eyes.
" You this idiot, you dare come to my palace to insult me... I will deal with you.! Guards!!" Said king Maduka.
"Why you is wickeding like this...I is coming back for you...you must pay!!" Kasima said crying as the guards rushed into the living room.
"Your majesty." They chorus bowing down their heads.
"Take this fool and lock her up in the palace cell, make sure you give her the best of her life." He said.
" As you wish my king." One of the guards said and turned to kasima.
"Oya move idiot!" He said as they start dragging her out..
"You is wickeding, you must pay!!" Said kasima with tearsful voice before she was dragged out.
"Daughter of a nobody, tomorrow by sunset.. I shall sacrifice her head to ikuku the great python." King Maduka said laughing devilishly. Princess Adaeze stood up from the couch and walked close to her father.
"Dad, did you really do it? I mean did you truly killed her father because of the throne as she said?" She asked.
"What is the meaning of that question?" King Maduka asked.
"That doesn't answer my question, I said did you truly killed kasima's father because of the throne?" Adaeze asked yelling.
"And if he truly did, what can you do?" Queen Diana asked making princess Adaeze to turned
"I see, so you are the one misleading him right?" She asked
"Are you trying to say you are not enjoying the status you are now and the respect you get from people?" Princess Olachi asked.
"I can never enjoy such respect, if you are enjoying to be called Princess when you are not,..I am not and beside...... "
"Oh shot your mouth! You empty vassel." Queen Diana interrupted Adaeze.
"Don't mind her, I guess this is how your useless mother bought you up." Prince Ikena said.
"Oh please, if you have nothing to say kindly keep quiet.. mummy's boy....you that a common woman slapped and you fell on the couch like a pregnant woman." Adaeze said and turned to her father.
"If I find out the truth that you killed kasima's father......."
"How dare you talk to me in such manner!" King Maduka interrupted and slapped her.
"Father you are evil and you must pay " Adaeze said in tears before walking out of the living room.
"Mother! Mother!" She called as she ran to her mother who was going to the living room.

            Mr Godwin sat on the side alongside with Cindy and wisdom..they were dressed and were obviously going out.
            "Honey please be fast." Mr Godwin said referring to his wife (Mrs Godwin) who was still upstairs in her room and turned his gaze to his wrist watch.
            Mrs Godwin on the other hand sat on the bed and dialed a number in her phone and place it on her left ear.

            "Thanks, have to go now...they are waiting for me." She said
            "Okay bye." Zacco said before she end the call. She called Sophia to know where she was and she told her that she is close to their house, she end the call and went downstairs.
            "Sweetheart am so sorry for keeping you waiting." She apologized innocently.

            "She will soon be here." She said.
            "Here I am." Sophia said walking into the living room as everybody turned their gaze to her. Cindy and wisdom mood changed instantly.
            "Mum, what is the meaning of this?" Wisdom asked angrily.
            "Calm down son." Mr Godwin said tapping wisdom on his shoulder.
            "Good day sir." Sophia greeted Mr Godwin then eyed Cindy and wisdom before hugging Mrs Godwin.
            "Dad, I am not going to use the same car with her." Cindy said pointing at Sophia.
            "Me too." Wisdom said.
            "Don't bother, she will use my car with me." Mrs Godwin said.
            "Is alright, let's get going." Mr Godwin said while they walked out of the living room and went to where their cars were packed. Wisdom, Cindy and Mr Godwin used wisdom's car while Mrs Godwin and Sophia used her car.
            As they were driving along the express road.. wisdom, Cindy and their father were gisting when a girl from nowhere suddenly ran into the road, it was obvious she escaped from danger, before wisdom could control the steering, he had already hit the girl with his car...she fell on the ground as blood was coming out of her head.... Wisdom jumped out of the car followed by his father and sister, they rushed to the girl on the ground.
            "God, what have I done?!" He said bitterly carrying the girl who has already passed out.
            Mrs Godwin and Sophia went to meet them.
            " What?..how did it happen?" Mrs Godwin asked confusedly but get no response, wisdom place the girl in the back seat while his sister sat with her, his father joined him in the front.
            "We are going to the hospital, are you coming with us??" Mr Godwin asked referring to his wife.
            "Yes." She managed to say after a long starred. Wisdom start the car and zoom off. Mrs Godwin hitter her hands on the steering so hard in frustration, she was boiling with anger.
            "What do we do now?" Sophia asked breaking the awake slience.
            "I don't know, our plan has be ruined by that bastard!" She yelled angrily.
            "I suggest we call zacco and inform him about the newest." Sophia said.
            "You are right." She concluded and took her phone from her bag, she dialed zacco number and informed him about what happened and when they are going to strake again. After the call, she drove to the hospital..

"If you talk I will blow off your head, just move quietly." The guy instructed and Kasima obeyed..she raised her hands up and went to the living room, seeing them Mr Godwin trampled in fear.
"Everybody lie down before I blow off your heads." Zacco said in a commanding tune.
"Please don't hurt her, she is my niece." Mr Godwin said sheviering..
"Oh really? Alright we won't hurt her, all we want is your money." Zacco said.
"Please I will give you any amount you want but please don't hurt me and my family." Mr Godwin pleaded.
"Shot up your mouth!! Now go in there and give us the money." Zacco said and turned to one of his guys.
"Spark, follow him." He ordered while spark followed Mr Godwin to his room, they took the money and came back to downstairs.
"Hey you stand up!" Zacco said referring to mrs Godwin while she stand up pretending to be scared..
"Please don't harm my wife." Mr Godwin pleaded.
"Shot up!!" Spark yelled at him.
"Spark, give her that gun." Zacco said while spark gave the gun to Mrs Godwin, she took the gun from him and smiled.
"Now kill your husband." Zacco said while she gladly cracked the gun and point the gun at Mr Godwin.
"Please Linda don't kill me." Mr Godwin pleaded.
"Why shouldn't I? Well since you don't know, I sent them to come over and kill you, wisdom and Kasima, you people would have be dead since last week if not for the accident that happened that day." She said.
"What! Mum!" Cindy and wisdom called together.
"I am not your mother, since your father refuse to tell you.. your late mother and I were friends, when she got married to your father I was very angry because I have eyes on your father...so I paid a nurse to injected your mother to death the day she gave birth to both of you. I start staying with your father..a year later your father and I got married. I have always desire to have all your father's wealth and that was why I insisted that you should marry Sophia but you were too stubborn like your late mother and today you all will die." She said and laughed devilishly..

"I hate you, I hate you wicked woman." Cindy said crying.
"Yes I am wicked because Today you all wi die." She said and was about pulling the trigger when they heard voices from the door.
