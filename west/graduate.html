              <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Episode 1 <br>
                Walking aimlessly through the street of Ado Ekiti has become my hobby, waking up like every other tenants in my lodge, getting dressed and hurrying to catch a cab in pretence of going to work was my everyday routine. I am Aderinola, a 24- year old graduate of Psychology from Ekiti State. I grew up in Ekiti but was lucky to have schooled in UNILAG.

                I served in Kebbi State and if there was a profession I hated, it was teaching…. I had gotten a job to teach at a standard secondary school in Odo- Ado but being a big Unilag graduate, I could not stoop so low to teaching a group of readymade spoilt brat who were coming to school to get a WAEC certificate….
                
                My parents were based in Ilawe Ekiti, father was a reknown and ” rich farmer” and mother was a trader… But to my friends except Fiwasaye, my father was a retired “rich” soldier and my mother, a businesswoman who was based in clothing’s… Yes now! My mother was a businesswoman or is there any difference between businesswoman and trader… Both r selling stuffs! And she was into clothing’s too because she was selling inner wears to some local market woman in Ilawe Ekiti. I hate to admit my parents were illiterates, but they were… Stark illiterates!! My dad could speak Yoruba fluently and he could communicate in English a little but my weird mother was prone to our native dialect, she could not speak fluent Yoruba and she was never afraid to speak it not even when she came to Lagos to visit me while I was in school.
                
                After my graduation, being their only surviving and educated daughter, my parents wanted me home but I bluntly refused., not after tasting the sweet life of Lagos but after much pleas from within and without, I agreed to settle down in Ado Ekiti, the state capital of Ekiti State, the fountain of knowledge and the state with the highest number of professors…
                
                Of the greatest “ule uyi,ule eye”.
                
                My parents rented a “self-con” for me in Falegan, a serene street along Ilawe road. I lived a double life, to my co- tenants, they believed I’m a lucky rich girl who worked in ACCESSBANK but truthfully, I dressed to kill. I took my time taking my bath and wearing makeup.
                
                Bet with me, I can name 10perfumes that worth #200 which had sweet scents…
                I used Dallas perfume and pocket perf and a couple of sprays. I possessed one thousand and one suits, suits were my favourite, ranging from skirt to trouser suits… While in the university,I was being mistaken for a banking and finance student and it went on till my graduation.
                Fiwasaye knew much about my second life, the pauper village girl, she was fond of calling me corporate omo oko or corporate ashewo.
                
                My daily routine: I woke up before five every morning, pray,brush my teeth and have my bath. Making myself up was my morning duty, none of my neighbours had mistakenly seen my natural look, I concealed all blackspot and pimples, I was always looking fresh in my makeups and truthfully, most if not all of my hard earned money goes into my makeups, if I don’t, how will I get more money? I rocked ombre lips better than most pro n models… After these, I go knocking on doors as I woke other tenants up before sweeping my room and veranda. If I had something to cook, better and if not, I would either eat at Mama Sikira or at Fiwa’s place.. It depended on my pocket. I leave home exactly 6 in the morning alongside my neighbours if I had money and before 6 if I don’t…
                
                Anyone who have ever been to Ado Ekiti will know Falegan is not far from Bank road, you don’t have to pass through Ola Oluwa school… There’s a shorter way of doing that*winks… I trekked down to Bank road and being a regular customer in most banks, I entered freely to check if there was any possible vacancy and sometimes to fetch customers
                One fateful day, it was one of the unfortunate days I trekked down to bank road, I entered into Zenith bank and sat at the reception even when I had no business in the bank premises. I was lost in my own thought of how to handle my dangling debt coupled with the fact that my carowhite cream was finished, so was my loose powder and I needed to buy a fake Brazilian hair.
                
                “Can you lend me your pen”
                It sounded too angelic and I thought I was in heaven. I lifted my face to meet the gaze of a young looking handsome , oh no! guy… I won’t call that face that of a man. I starred straight into that eyes for some few seconds trying to fathom what planet they fell from.. The man shifted a bit and looked back trying to know if I was actually staring at something else.
                
                The man shook me repeatedly after seeing how blankly I was staring at him and shouted..
                
                “Hello miss, are you alright” my heart melt. It sounded rather romantic than been worried. I came back seconds later and adjusted vehemently in my seat.
                
                “Pardon my manners” I said in my best tone
                
                “You look pale, what were you thinking of” he asked still looking worried.
                
                “You asked for a pen” I said opening my bag searching for one.
                
                I handed it over to him as I waited patiently for my Princecharming. He was not the best of all handsome men but damnit! His skin was radiant and his voice could soften a hardened stone. I waited patiently for two hours before my Princecharming appeared again.
                
                “I was worried you would have left” He said stretching his hand in a bid to return my UBA inscribed pen..
                
                I received it two years ago while serving in Kebbi. It was the pen the manager of the bank I opened gave me, he was my man friend.
                
                “I am stranded” It slipped rather too fast that I could not control it.
                My Princecharming stood rooted on a spot as he checked me out from head to toe…
                
                “I thought you work here”
                
                “No, I worked with ECOBANK”
                
                “OH! The bank the Governor locked” he said out of pity.
                
                “Yes”
                
                “Let’s get out of here” He said
                
                “Pardon!” It sounded more like, “let us go to my house”
                
                “Do you wanna stay here like forever” he gave me a puzzled look.
                I immediately stood up knowing fully well I had fumbled. This man was distracting me and I could not help it… I led and he followed closely. We got outside and I could see him more clearly, he was tall and well built…
                
                My exact type of man, he was wearing a white shirt, a black pair of trousers, a wine blazer and the sun could not have shone the way his black shoes were shining.
                
                “You stare a lot. Follow me to my car” he made to move and I follow closely behind.

                  “You stare a lot. Follow me to my car” he made to move and I follow closely behind.

                  I followed him to his Car and we opted in, believe me, I knew I had hit a jackpot!
                  This man was driving a G-wagon in this part of Nigeria. I started reminiscing and calculating those I was owing, my makeup kits, and all other expenses .
                  
                  I was lost in my thought that I did not noticed this guy had been talking to me.
                  “Are you alright” he shook me vehemently.
                  
                  “Yes, I am” I shifted confortably and concentrated.
                  
                  “Have been asking what your name is since and u were just staring at me blankly”
                  
                  “Oh! I’m sorry. My name is Riri”.
                  
                  ” Is that an Igbo name?”
                  
                  “Shortened form of Aderinola”
                  
                  “Oh! I am Shina, Shinaayomi” he added quickly.
                  
                  “Where do you stay”
                  
                  “Falegan”
                  
                  “My parents are based here in Ado but I’m based in lag even though I’m new in Nigeria”[/b] he explained calmly “I’ll be in town for some couple of months”
                  
                  “Oh really” I said smiling.
                  
                  “What are you doing in the bank” he asked
                  
                  “Ehm…. Ehm… I actually came to withdraw” I stammered
                  
                  “To withdraw? But you said you’re stranded” he said confusingly.
                  “Shina, it’s a long story. Two things brought me to the bank, to withdraw and search for work. My parents promised to send me some cash today.” I said soberly. That was one of the begging tactics I used on men.
                  “Eeya. Can I take you home”
                  
                  “Home?” It was still some minutes to two and I am not expected to be home yet at least as a banker. I was lost in thought thinking of an excuse.
                  
                  “You don’t want me to know your house, Aderin” He asked looking dejected.
                  
                  “Why not, I stay in Falegan” I said quickly as the thought of losing that handsome man crossed my mind.
                  
                  Shinaayomi eventually took me home and gave me fifteen thousand naira with the promise to check on me the next day. It was my happiest day.
                  
                  I could not enter my house before I rushed down to Fiwasaye’s shop, I stopped and paid Mama Sikira my debt and also Bello. Bello was the mei tea at my junction.I would buy tea, noodles and bread and package it inside either Captain cook, Take away or chicken republic nylon. Don’t ask me where I got them, I could be lucky to eat lunch there once in few months but to my neighbours, I eat there everyday! Fake life was the best to me! A lot of people accorded me with respect because I knew how best to”package” myself.
                  
                  On getting to Fiwa’s shop, I greeted her and handed her the sum of five thousand naira.
                  
                  “Corporate Ashawo, wetin b dis”
                  “Stop calling me that! You have customers now” I replied angrily.
                  “No one is listening”
                  
                  “Does that matters, walls have ears”
                  “Where you c money”
                  “How much am I owing”
                  ” 3,765″
                  “Who’s spending #5 in this period”
                  “You still have 1,235”
                  “Keep the change” I replied feeling fly
                  “Riri, who have you money”
                  “Iwa, you won’t believe I’ll be getting married soon” pardon me readers, In the “packaging” business, there is something you must know how to do well, it’s “lying”… I, Aderinola can sell the whole Nigeria with lies. I’ was born,bred and buttered in ” LIES”. My father could lie and my mother was always his witness so as we, the children.
                  
                  “Who will marrying our Almighty corporate…”
                  
                  “Shut it!”[/b] I shut her off
                  
                  “Who is marrying our Riri” she asked rolling her eyes. She knew all my tactics, she was the torn in my flesh. She knew me better than my parents and she rolling her eyes meant one thing, She does not believe me.
                  
                  I left Fiwa’s shop and took a bike to Chuks, my makeup customer at the market. I was owing him the total sum of #550 which I paid and bought my loose powder and some essentials.(if you will agree with me: as either a makeup artist, or a makeup lover,never take more than you’ve budgeted to a makeup shop/studio or else you end up spending more than you have? I got some foodstuffs and soup ingredients and when I got home that evening, I had less than #2000. I was nervous that I could not sleep all through the night expecting Shina’s cal which seems like a dream not coming true. I was home the next day after feigning sick to my neighbours.
                  I decided against calling Shina and the day ended without a call or visit from him.I was disappointed throughout the week not seeing Shina and after a whole week of mourning Shina, I chose to move on.
                  
                  I dusted my CV and my trekking shoes and went back to the street. I was working down the street of GRA one hot Thursday afternoon lost in my own thoughts when a red car stopped by,at first I paid less attention to the car and walked passed it until the driver horned, I stopped to look at the driver but it was a tinted glass, knocked repeatedly but no response. I tried peeping through the tinted glass but all I could see is a couple arguing so I moved on,the car followed so I decided to pick a bike home. I had to borrow money from Mama Sikira to pay the biker rider. It was some minutes to 7 when a call came in and the caller asked to me to come outside. I was so eager to know who it was so I went so immediately
                  
                  I saw a familiar red car outside my compound, it was the red car I saw in the afternoon. I was confused ,paused and was trying to fathom whom it was. I was lost in my own thoughts when I heard the car horn.I took grip of myself and went to where the car was parked. I knocked on the windscreen and it was wound down. Guess who?
                  
                  It was my Princecharming!!! I screamed so loud that all my akproko neighbours rushed outside to see who it was. I felt embarrassed and entered into the car to avoid story that touched.
                  
                  “Aderin”
                  
                  “Shina”
                  
                  “Can I talk to you?”
                  
                  “Where have you been? No calls, no chats, no messages”
                  
                  “I’ve been through alot these past few weeks”
                  
                  “Like what and what?”
                  
                  “I’m going back to the states”
                  
                  “Why?”
                  
                  “My parents, they don’t love me” he screamed. I was disappointed, devasted. I was quiet and every time I tried opening my mouth to talk… It was so dry and silky.
                  
                  “Aderin, can I sleep here this night?”
                  
                  “You mean…. My…my room?” I stammered
                  
                  “Yea… I need somewhere to rest my head and cool my mind.”
                  
                  “Hotel… There are five stars hotels around, why my room?” I regretted those words almost immediately.
                  
                  “Are you trying to drive me away?” He asked disappointed.
                  
                  “Why should I, Shina? I mean a man of your caliber and status…(I paused)… Moreso,we met once, we’re friends and… and… I don’t know your intentions” I looked up seeing Shina beaming with smiles.I felt foolish.
                  
                  “So you have a dirty mind?” He asked laughing out so hard.
                  
                  “Was it so funny?”
                  
                  “Oh I’m sorry. I know all hotels around here but I just want someone to talk to. I need someone to lend me some listening ears. You fits into my demands, Riri. You are such an amazing woman.”
                  He poured out. I was quiet for a period of time because My room was a bit absorb. My unwashed pants were lying in my bed.
                  
                  “Let us go inside” I opted out immediately and he locked his car and followed almost immediately. I was looking for the perfect lie concerning my unwashed p@anties but found none. As we got into my compounds, all my neighbours, I mean all my neighbours, my neighbours’ neighbours, my neighbours’ children,boyfriends,girlfriends and street members were hanging around all staring at my Princecharming. To be truthful,Shina smelt of riches, even though he was dressed in a joggers n tees, he was a head turner.
                  My head was so swollen that I could not help feeling on top of the world. I looked back and discovered everyone was greeting him,even some were trying to form familiarity. I took it as an opportunity to rushed into my room,I cleared my room and rushed out to pick Shina. On getting outside, what and who I saw shocked me.

                It was Onome! Let me tell me a lil about Onome. Onome was a professional, dirty and shameless prostitute. She goes after everything under pants.. When I say pants, I mean PANTS. p@anties ranging from boxers to pants. She was bisexual that is she does both males and females. It was through Onome that I knew it was through that Edo women loves pricks.
                She dated our landlord,our house agent,co-tenants and street guys. She cared less if you were married or single.
                
                She would date both husbands and wives and some even hired her for 2-3sums. She was a w---e! But one thing about her, I was a thorn in her flesh. She never believed I was what I said I was, she would stalk me just to know my true identity but trust me, I was smarter.
                
                My makeups customers was hers, so was my “benddown select” customer.
                
                Onome was discussing with Shina who was sitting on a stool and surrounded by my neighbours.
                
                “I’ve met you somewhere” she was talking to Shina in a tone I’ve never seen her used on a guy.
                
                “I? Where was that?”
                
                “I don’t know, where are you staying”
                
                “I’ve been in this town.”
                
                “Oh… Maybe in Prosperous”
                
                “I’ve never been there”” I’m new in this area”
                
                “Oh really, where were you staying before. Maybe it was from there we met.”
                
                “Been in the states but was in Lagos earlier” This drew the attention I needed, my neighbours marvelled upon hearing Shina was from the states. I felt highlighted and earned more respect… Atleast as a banker dating a Londoner. I withdrew Shina from the crowd and took him in.
                
                “You’ve got a nice apartment” he commented searching through my room.
                
                “Thanks”
                
                “Your neighbours are fun to be with especially the fair lady”
                
                “Be careful of her. She’s dangerous.”
                
                “Someone here is jealous.” He rolled his eyes blushing.
                
                “About who and how?”
                
                “You better tell me the truth. You’re falling already…”
                
                “What can I offer you…” That was my greatest mistake, why would I ask such question when I had nothing at home, not even sachet water. I blamed myself for trying to change the topic.
                
                “Anything would do.”
                
                “But… But… I’ve nothing at home right now. Just planning to get some tomorrow.”
                
                “Is there any fast food close by?”
                “Captain cook is at Fayose.”
                
                “Let’s go there.” Before I could say jack Robinson,he was up dragging me out.
                
                “Do you want me to go out this way?” I asked immediately we got into the car.I was wearing a bumshot and croptop.
                
                “I love my woman looking hot and sexy.”
                
                “But this is Ado not Lag or wherever.”
                
                “I care less.”He ignited and off we went. I was reminiscing on the ” my woman” thingy.
                
                We got some food and Suya and ate, I wanted to ask if his car was the same I saw yesterday when his phone rang
                
                “Hello”
                
                “Get the f--k off, I ain’t coming home till u guys r in d right senses.”
                
                “You don’t command me like some kids, I’m a grown up, man”
                
                “I ain’t in no hotels, I’m with my woman” I was alarmed.
                
                “Believe me, you ain’t seeing me till I return to the states.”
                
                “Get the f--k of my phone” he said and hung up.
                
                “Who was that?” I asked silently.
                
                “My mum” he replied burning with fury.
                
                “You mean you’re addressing your mum like that?”
                
                “Riri, I was the one you saw in the afternoon” he caught me off guard. I never knew he was reading my mind.
                
                “How? Why didn’t you talk to me then?”
                
                “I was with that witch.”he was now on his feet angrier than ever.
                
                ” Your mum?”
                
                “Aderin, marry me.” He stressed these word looking so pale. I didn’t believed my ears,we’d seen for the second time and Londoner was talking about marriage. It sounded like “Aderin, maga me” rather than marry me.
                
                “What are you talking about?” I asked trying to conceal the confusion written all over my face.
                
                “Riri, when I met you, I felt this kinda chemistry you feel while in love. You see, I’m 31 and unmarried, I’m in Nigeria to get a wife but my parents ain’t helping me.”
                
                “How?”
                
                “Marry me, we’re getting married before next month ends and going back to the states in two months.”
                
                “Is that a command?”
                
                “No, I’m being straight. I can’t stoop to the level of wooing a woman. We’re adults, matured adults”” I am going to take care of you. I wanna use you to get back to my parents”
                
                “Your parents? How?
                
                ” Riri, I knew you saw the lady in my car! She was the hoe my parents want for me. How could they expect me to marry a lady all because we promised to love and marry each other while we were young…
                Accepted I deflowered her and she aborted my baby but she is a w---e! She was going after all men in UNILAG while I was away and had several other abortions.” He was now shouting so Loud that I feared my neighbours were eavesdropping.
                
                “Yeah, I loved her but I love her no more. Riri, it’s you I want”” you’re so decent and promising.” His last comment was a lie. I knew I was not decent, I was a corporate prostitute in UNILAG too. I was still into “ashewo business till that moment even if it was codedly
                
                I was confused, even though I had started developing feeling for Shina, I was never ready for some kind of poo.
                
                “Shina, let us take things easy”
                
                “This is me, and here is you, I’m 31 for Petes’ sake, do you expect me to start begging and wooing you like a kid?” He lied on the bed in anger and soaked under the duvet, I mean blanket.
                I was up for a moment thinking if my life.
                I was a blunt broke liar and my lying game took me nowhere. You have to lie to cover a lie. I’d leaving a fake like since my uni days and it never paid me. I’d lose a reasonable amount of good suitors because I could not afford to take them to my parent after bragging about being a rich kid. A good example was Victor, Victor was an IB boy, he was a rich coded yahoo guy and believed I was a banker, after gaining a substantial amount from his yahoo plus business, he decided to open an account with access bank where he believed I was working, I was able to cover up till when I couldn’t and he knew I was never working in Access bank… I tried to cover up and that was when he asked to meet my parents, that was where kasala busted and I could not get a tangible lie to tell, I opened up and told him about my real parents, he broke up with me immediately but his words hurt more, he said he was dating me because he thought I was from a rich home and. Could not stoop too low dating the daughter of a village illiterates. He went ahead and got married to a lady close to my house. I made up my mind right then never to open up who my real parents were to any man. After all, I could rent parents.
                
                “Do you have to think about it this much?” I heard Shina said as he pushed up into the sitting position. It sounded more like “do you have to think about being f----d this much?”. He drew me so close that I was afraid he would swallow me.
                
                ” I love you, Riri”
                
                “I want you to carry my babies” “not someone who had over three known abortions” Truth being told, I had six abortions before I met Shina, I knew instantly I was not the best for him.
                
                “Shina, let us take things slow. I understand how you’re feeling but we shouldn’t rush” I said as I withdrew myself from him.
                
                “Okay. I’ll give you from now till tomorrow”
                
                “That is better” before I could blink, Shina had kissed me, and right on that spot, my body and soul was vibrating, I felt a chemistry which I’ve never felt for a guy in ages. He noticed my strange feelings and stopped.
                
                “I’m sorry, Riri. I never meant to go far.” He begged with an embarrassment look.
                
                “I understand..” I said laying in the bed.
                
                “Goodnight, my woman” he said as he la!d down facing the opposite direction. I relaxed so well thinking about the kiss and Shina. I felt strange, I was scared of s-x for the first time in my life.
                
                I was afraid Shina was going to wake me up in the middle of the night and forced me to s-x. He was not sleeping neither, he kept tossing around till I feltasleep around 2am . I dreamt about getting married to Shina in a big way, and guess what, my parents came in the middle of the reception. I fainted on seeing them and Shina was shooking me trying to wake me up
                
                “My woman, wake up” I opened my eyes just to see myself in bed and Shina standing over me fully dressed. I was disappointed, I wanted to go back and sleep, I love my dream…

                  “Shina, are you up already?”

                  “Yes Honey. I’m going home right now,something came up” he said adjusting his wristwatch.
                  
                  “To do what” I sprang up, deepdown, I love his company and I wanted to be with him more especially because of food.
                  
                  “Mum needs me, I’ll be back in a jiffy” he pecked me n left my room.
                  I slept a little more and decided to do some chores, I swept the room and on unlocking my door, I heard doors cracking and people coming out, I opened the door and the first person who greeted me was Sheyi.
                  
                  Sheyi was my next door neighbour, he was so fake that even his hairstyle was fake, he also was a perfect ‘runsboy’who makes money from servicing old women, dear readers, Sheyi was a liar, serial cheat, womanbeater, imposter and a ‘yahooyahoo’ he afforded a tainted black Toyota ‘pencillight’ Camry and to him, it was a baby, the car was his wife. He was a university dropout but lied to everyone that he was a masters student in EKSU. I did not believed him, he knew I knew he knew I never believed him, he could boast for Europe. He tried to avoid me always especially the day I caught him with our co-tenant’s wife and also our Almighty Onome, he hated me and was always doubting my lifestyle.
                  For the first time in 2015, he greeted me’
                  “Riri, morning to you” he approached smiling, I noticed almost everyone in the house was around that Friday morning and I knew their reason: APROKOS.
                  
                  “Morning, Sheyi”
                  
                  “I fetched those two jerrycans for you when water came” I was surprised, everyone murmured. One thing about Sheyi, he would not do anything for you for free and if he did, you’re going to pay in a way you never expected.
                  
                  A case study was when Mr. Onabisi, a former neighbour traveled to Onitsha and on his arrival, Sheyi went to pick him from the park, it was later when Mr. Onabisi sent his wife packing and later packed out of the house that we knew Sheyi was smashing Mrs. Onabisi and the day he went to pick the husband, they strafed.
                  Immediately, I knew he was up to something but trust me,I was smarter. “Thanks” I said
                  
                  “You are welcome.” He said grinning,”more so, I want to see you later.” He said and left.
                  
                  “Aunty Riri, how’s your visitor” it was Mama Susan who asked.
                  
                  “Which one” I asked. By now, all my neighbours were either leaning on the railings or standing by their doorpost and little who were matured were peeping through their windows.
                  
                  Mama Susan was our street back bitter, she was married to Baba Susan, an Hausa man who was a ‘mekanika ejiniarin”(mechanical engineer) like his wife would say. She was a fullhouse wife and it gave her all the time needed to pokenose into others affairs. She could open her mouth and say anything to anyone at anytime. There was an instance which happened few months back when Onome was strafing ‘Magic fingers’, another internet fraudster in my street and one Mr. Hammed, a banker, Magic fingers had a girlfriend who was schooling in EKSU who was a living-in girlfriend while Mr. Hammed was married, Mama Susan told Magic finger’s girlfriend Onome’s escapades when they were both making hair at a salon down the street, what actually happened was that, Onome was close to Caro, Magic finger’s girlfriend and took her as her street sister,so Caro was at the salon making hair when Onome walked in, greeted her and left, that was when mama Susan opened the can of worms, how magic fingers would sneaked into our compound, how Onome was visiting him while Caro was in school and how they would go to an hotel and straffed in his car. Caro, being a crazy Ado babe left the Salon without finishing her hair and went to ask Magic fingers if they were all true, he denied it but Caro had plans already, she offered to pay Mama Susan a substantial amount to track them down and call her anytime they were together, Mama Susan declined the money and promised to help her for free.
                  
                  The d-day came and it was on a Saturday evening, Magic fingers came into our compound under the guise of coming to seeSheyi but later sneaked into Onome’s room, trust Mama Susan, she called Caro immediately and it happened….
                  ….
                  I was sitting on the long bench outside my room that fateful night when Caro came, at first, I thought Magic fingers was in Sheyi’s not until Caro passed Sheyi door and knocked at Onome’s door, she knocked softly that no one could smell the danger lurking around until Sheyi came outside his room.
                  
                  “Babe, how far?” He said grinning”Magic fingers no dey here na” he said smiling sheepishly.
                  
                  “Do I tell you I’m looking for Magic fingers, e don’t dey house na, I wan borrow comb from Onome”
                  
                  “Okay” Sheyi said and knocked. “Onome, come out o, na me” it was later we knew Sheyi knew Caro’s plan but decided to watch free match between Onome’ Pacquiao’ and Caro eyan mayweather.. He was seeing Onome and was jealous magic fingers enjoyed Onome more than him. Onome opened the door and before she could look up, Caro dragged her out letting her towel fell and believe me, she was stark naked, Mama Susan handed a readily prepared water and garri to Caro who bathed with it, they fought and Onome who was already naked tore Caro’s top revealing some fresh flesh, the fight was so interesting that everybody in the street including the Okada riders were all watching free p--n movie. Even though, most of them had tasted Onome, Caro’s visible upper body was the center of attraction. Caro sighted Magic fingers who was almost escaping and they started another round of argument, Magic fingers exposed his girlfriend claiming he was not in love with her again because after spending his money onher, she still drew s-x timetable for him and Onome, the animashaun was there to service him. They argued and fought for over 45minutes when we heard a shout…
                  Onome ran outside in paining shouting on the top of her voice, she was followed by a man who was in boxers who ran speedily out of our compound , everyone was confused and lost, even Caro and Magic fingers had to step outside for the new episode of the seasonal movie.
                  
                  A womancame out of Onome’s room with a bucket half filled with pepper, to cut the story short, when onome saw that Magic fingers and Caro were arguing and fighting, everyone was engrossed that no one knew when Mr. Hammed, the banker entered into her room, Mama Susan on seeing her rushed to call Mrs. Hammed who hurriedly brought along a bucket of pepper anddud justice to Onome and her husband. No one knew when Caro and magic fingers left our compound and the next morning, they were together, Magic fingers drove Caro to school, I SMH,
                  
                  Dear readers, would you be in a relationship suffering domestic violence? What’s your take on this before I move on

                ”Look here, Mama Susan, I don’t owe you an explanation” I said

                “Riri, can I come and make your hair for you?” Onome said, lest I forget, Onome was a talented hairdresser, she didn’t learn it but could make all types of hair, people were always begging her to make their hair but Onome preferred servicing men and women to making hair, the only few women Onome made hair for were her l£sb!an partners.I really wanted her to make my hair but I did not want any closer relationship with her.
                
                “No, thanks” I replied bluntly and entered my room. I waited till evening and Shina was not back yet, so I believed he would not come that day. I got dressed and went to Fiwasaye’s shop, I explained everything to her and she adviced I thread with Shina carefully.
                
                “I’m always skeptical about all this guys, be careful”
                
                “I will”
                
                “Derin, please stop living this double lifestyle. Can’t you do without lies? What if this guy decided to marry you and meet your parents?”
                
                “My parents?” I cut in. “I’m renting parents o, do you want my parents especially my mum to embarrass me like the last time?”
                
                “Your parents are your parents, Ade. We’re from Ilawe Ekiti, and have you forgotten what your parents went through to send you to school. Oh! You’ve forgotten you are the only graduate in your family?”
                
                “Fiwa, why are they illiterates? Why are they poor?”
                
                I barked at her.
                
                “Ade, your parents are richer than mine yet I love them, your mother saw me the last time I went home and complained you neither call them nor pick their calls, you don’t go to Ilawe. Ade, treat your parents right, they suffered too much for you”
                
                “How am I suppose to treat them? I’m broke,I’m jobless. Aren’t you the one who fed me earlier? I don’t have a dime with me”
                
                “What if their spirits are fighting you, you don’t treat them right, you’re not proud having them as your parents, why? Are they disabled? Your mum gave birth to you, your dad fathered you”
                
                “I will go and see them next weekend, is that all?”
                
                “No, that’s not. Stop living a fake life and get a life!”
                
                “How do you mean, fiwa?” I eyed her
                
                “Rinsola, there are lots of guys out there who are ready to help you, your pride and lies are chasing them off” she advised.
                
                “Okay” I said and just then, my phone rang, it was Shina.
                
                “Hello” I said immediately I picked his call
                
                “Where are you, Riri? I’m outside the gate.” I sprang up.
                
                “I came to see a friend, I’m on my way.”
                
                “Just give me the direction and I’ll come and pick you.” I gave him the address and ended the call.
                
                “Who was that?” Fiwa asked
                “Shina”
                
                “Is he coming here” She asked smiling
                
                “Oh yeah” I said feeling happy
                “I’ll get to know your Princecharming” We gisted for some minutes before I received a call from Shina that he was closed by. I went outside and recognised his G-wagon immediately. Deep down, I was happy Fiwasaye would be surprised to see how rich Shina was. I waved at him and he stopped right in front of Fiwa’s shop. He alighted and followed me into her shop where I introduced them to each other.
                
                “Thanks for taking care of my woman.”
                
                “My pleasure, Mr. Shina. I hope you’re not going to break my friend’s fragile heart?” She responded jokingly.
                
                “Obviously not” They chatted for some minutes before we left her shop.
                On getting to my house, everyone was marvelled when they saw us alighted from the vehicle.
                
                “Oga, wetin you carry come na” Mama Susan asked. Shina handed over some naira notes to her and we went inside. I heard Mama Susan and others arguing who should take the greater share.
                
                “I’m sorry I was late” he apologized.
                
                “Its nothing”
                
                “Mum wanted me to come back home, I told her about you already and she’s ready to meet you”
                
                “Shina!” I was surprised.
                
                “Riri,I know you like me” he winked. I later agreed to his proposal that night and we started dating officially.
                We chatted like a long time couples and slept late that night.
                
                The following morning being a Saturday was less hectic, we were indoors in the morning and went to the market to get foodstuffs and soup ingredients, Shina bought them in bulk, we got back home, cooked,ate and when it was time to sleep, Shina asked me what I intended doing since I was jobless
                
                “I pray I get an appointment in any of these banks o”
                
                “I hate white collar jobs for my woman,Riri. As my wife, I preferred you venture into business or learn a skill.”
                
                “I love your makeups, Riri. Are you an artist?”
                
                “No, I do my things my lil way” I answered covering my face.
                
                “Do you know any of the makeup artist in town?”
                
                “MerryGold is Fiwa’s customer.”
                “Do you have her number?”
                “No but Fiwa should have it”
                “Do you know her studio?”
                “Yes”
                
                “We’ll go see her on Monday”
                “Why?” I asked.
                
                “I’ll enroll you”
                I was enrolled into MerryGold makeup school on Monday, that week went smoothly and I hailed respect from my boss, my colleagues and neighbours. I grew wings, I was no longer eating at Mama Sikira buka and after work, I would visit Fiwa at her place, I lied to my neighbours I retired my banking job because my fiancee was against it. Few weeks later, I was at Fiwa’s shop when Bola came in.
                
                “Hello girls” she greeted
                
                “Amber Rose!” We hailed her. Bola was Fiwa’s hostel mate while we were in school. We were not close because she always try to intimidate me, she was one of the people who doubt my “self-acclaimed rich babe” lifestyle. She was the CEO and managing director of the ” runs girl club”while we were in school. Even though, she was from a rich home and had a fiancée abroad, she was a bad gang, she drove the latest car, wore the latest wig and designer clothes. Even though I was proud, she was the pride herself. She nicknamed herself Amber Rose because of her killershape and tinted low cut, she was truly Amber Rose. Even though we learnt she had a botox surgery to get her killershape but she was pretty, she smelt rich and the way she carried herself, I was always afraid to visit Fiwa anytime she was around. Fiwa was no saint too, she followed her for the “runs” job anytime she needed money. My pride could not allow me to go with them, I did my thing my way, I was a one-man mopol, even though we met at hotels few times but we would pretend as if we never met not until one day an Alhaji invited me for two sums and Amber Rose was my partner, we were both shocked and even though we did our thing that day, Amber Rose knew I was living a fake life and reported me to Fiwa after she warned me to stop tagging myself as a good girl.
                
                “Hey babes!” She said as she sat down on the chair opposite us.
                
                “You decided to check me today?” Fiwa said frowning.
                
                “I came for my p@anties” she replied smiling
                
                “I said it, but why don’t you call me to deliver them instead of coming here, Biggest babe”
                
                “I ordered for some Christian Louboutin shoes for myself and my fiancée”
                
                “Is he in town”
                
                “Yea, that’s why i wanted those Sexy Victoria’s secret lingeries” she said tapping her hands.
                
                “Iyawo iyawo, can wait to buy asoebi”
                
                “Abi o” she laughed. “We’re getting married very soon and I’ll be relocating abroad to be with my husband.”She said flashing her engagement ring
                
                “I am happy for you, my dear” I said.
                
                “Everyone is getting married, why am I the only single one here.”
                
                “Who else is getting married.”
                
                “Riri! She’s relocating to the states too”
                
                “Riri, is that true?” She asked looking surprised
                
                “Don’t mind her o” I responded feeling uncomfortable.
                
                “I said it, you! The greatest alakada! Relocating to the states?” She said smiling, everywhere was silent.
                
                “I know her fiancée, Bola. More so, Riri is a changed person”
                
                “Whatever! Get me my package and let me go” she said sounding pissed. Fiwa handed her a pink polythene bag with the inscription “Victoria’s Secret”.
                
                ” How much is my bill?”
                “45k”
                “I’ll do the transfer when I get home.” She said and left.
                
                “Why she dey vex” Fiwa directed her gaze towards me after Amber Rose left.
                
                “No be una friend she be”
                
                “She think say na only her fit marry Americana?” She said and hissed.
                
                “Bad Belle” I added. Shina came later to pick me , he took me to a detached duplex in Bashiri.
                
                “Where is this, Shina?” She asked.

  <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Episode 6 <br>
    ”This is our new house, baby. I don’t like your house, it’s too exposed, I want privacy.” I stood rooted to the spot, it was my dream house.

    “Are you going to stand there?” Shina asked. I moved closer to him and hugged him.
    
    “I love you” I said sincerely, he was my first love, it was the first time I was loving a man with all my heart. I loved him not only because he was rich, but also he was truthful,sincere and caring. Shina and I never had s-x even though we had been together for a month. He was a perfect gentleman. We were a perfect couple. We packed into our new house the following my friend’s wish. I called Fiwa that morning to inform her about our relocation.
    
    “I’m happy for you, Riri” she said over the phone.
    
    “Thanks, girlfriend. I can’t believe God is changing my fate.!”
    
    “Riri, must you relocate into the new house with him,I’m skeptical about everything. It’s too early.”
    
    “We’re getting married soon, Fiwa.”
    
    “I understand but I’ve you forgotten this man is having issues with his parents, do you think this is gonna end well”
    
    “We met with his mum recently and she accepted me.”
    
    “But you lied to her,Riri!”
    
    “Will I tell her my parents are illiterates? Fiwa, you’re the only friend I have, I’m just a victim of bad circumstances. My parents are poor and I’m jobless. If not for this guy, would I be a certified makeup artist? I found love! I found him!” I poured out.
    
    “Riri, I understand you quite well but I don’t want you to relocate completely with him. Just pick a few things and don’t let your neighbors know about it” she warned before she ended the call. I wanted to follow her advice but Shina told me to pack all my load and drop the key for the caretaker.
    
    That night while we were ready to sleep, Shina asked me if I had any secrets I was keeping which I denied vehemently. We made love that night and I could see through his eyes that he was disappointed but I didn’t know why.
    His actions and reactions the next day was cold towards me, he refused to eat breakfast before he went out. I went to see Fiwa the following afternoon after a makeup session and told her about Shina’s new behavior.
    
    “Riri, please, tell Shina about your past life. Why not come out clean” she advised.
    
    “Fiwa, I’m confused. I’d lied but I can’t afford to loose Shina. I love him and I don’t see a future without him”
    I poured out. I was confused.
    
    “You can’t have a happy home being a liar. He will soon be aware of your lies. Stop being fake!!!”
    
    “Do you want me to loose him”
    
    “Just tell him about your past life and I’m sure he will forgive u.”
    
    “Fiwa, here is a man who broke his engagement because a woman confessed of having 2 abortions in his absence. Fiwa, I had 6 abortions” I said amidst cries.
    
    “I’m confused.you ruined it all from the beginning” I went home shattered that day. I was not happy and I started living in fear. I knew sooner or later, my secrets would be exposed. Shina stopped making love to me but he continued loving me. In a few week, I forgot my dilemma and it happened!
    I was in the kitchen preparing lunch when I heard a knock… I was lazy to go check who was at the door so I pretended not to hear since Shina was in the bedroom. I continued with my work, when i heard Shina’ s footsteps and the door cracking. It was a familiar female voice, I listen carefully as they exchange pleasantry and decided to clear my doubt about whose voice it was, and seeing Dommy in my house that afternoon melt my heart. Who is Dommy?
    
    I labelled her “dummy” because she was my diehard enemy, she hated me right from our days in Saint Louis Grammar School, Ikere Ekiti. I was a neat,pompous girl back then and all my school mates back then were jealous of me because every time we had the privilege to go outside our school gates,
    all “Anco” boys (Saint Louis Grammar School is a girls’ school while Annunciation*anco* is our male *version*) rushed me like houseflies. Everyone was jealous of me including Dummy. She crushed on Fife, Anco headboy while we were in SS3, but I ended up dating him.
    This made her hate me. When we met in UNILAG, She was Amber Rose’s friend, which worsen her hatred for me. Amber Rose told her about my fake lifestyle and she labelled me “fake Rihanna Alakada”. What was she doing I’m my house, our house? I thought. She focused her gaze towards me immediately I came into the living room.
    
    ” oh my! Riri!!!”She screamed and hugged me. I was confused, she was my sworn enemy and her warm treatment gave me goosebumps.
    
    “What are you doing here? Do you work with Shina?” She asked smiling.
    “She is my wife, my fiancé” Shina responded before I could say anything. I looked into Dummy’s eyes and she looked into mine, I could see she was heartbroken,surprised and frightened. We exchanged gaze for few seconds before she announced her departure.
    
    “I think I’ve to be on my way” she said as she picked her bag that was lying on the couch.
    
    “Lunch is almost ready” I said, I did not know when those words came out of my mouth and it sounded like “poison is ready”
    
    “I can’t wait, dear. Maybe some other time. See ya, Shina. Kisses” she blew us kiss as she left hurriedly.
    
    “What’s happening, darling.” I asked worriedly. Was she Shina’s ex fiancée? If she was, then I’m in trouble. Shina snubbed me and sat on the couch.
    
    “Is food ready?” He asked as he retired into the couch looking tired. We ate lunch in total silence that afternoon. No one was speaking to another, I guessed we were both lost in our thoughts.
    
    I visited Fiwa the following day and explained everything that happened to her. She was worried about me, and my past lifestyle.
    
    “Aderin, I’ll advise you to open up and let your fiancée knows about your past life. You know Dommy! She is dangerous.” She advised.
    
    “It would be better Shina hears from the horse mouth than from a third party. Aderin, open up!” I was weeping already, how could I look into Shina’s eyes and tell him I had six abortions, how would I tell his mum my mother was an illiterate! Life was so unfair to me and I wished death could take my soul. The thought of losing Shina made my dreams shattered, he was my love, my dream and I could feel no future without him.
    
    Fiwa was consoling me as I was sobbing when Dummy entered. I was shocked! The look on her face was scary, she came in with her hands akimbo, she stepped aside as someone else came in. I meant someone from my past!!
    
    Who came in? Who is Shina’s ex fiancée?

    It was Bola. I was confused, she was followed by Diamond, I didn’t know her real name.

    “Here you are, husband snatcher!” I was confused, why would they gang up against me. “Wanna-be!!” Diamond clapped .
    
    “What soap did u used? You used your village juju on my fiancée abi? I looked up,it was Bola who spoke.
    
    [b]
    ” fiancée? “I asked looking shocked, I returned my gaze towards Fiwa, she was shocked also.
    
    ” I know you too well, Aderin. You purposely snatched my man. I’m not hear to listen to some craps.. I knew you lied, you think Shina can marry you. You’re no saint, my dear.”she said sitting on the stool.
    
    “Riri, I know Shina is not aware of your past life, mine was better yet he left… So, get a life, sis. We’ve been together for over 15 years” “I’m giving you two good days. Leave my man!” She said as they stormed out. I was confused. I knew Amber Rose too well, Dummy was dangerous, Diamond was cunning. I knew my end is near, I smelt doom.
    
    “Are you going to sit there all day” I heard Fiwa speak, it sounded like “are you going to die today?”
    “Fiwa, what will happen to my relationship?” I asked
    
    “Just get home and tell Shina about it. I warned you earlier… I do!” I was close to tears, I picked my bag and left her shop without any other words.
    I got home and locked myself in the guest’s room.I left a note on table telling Shina not to look for me, I told him I went to see my parents. I heard him reading it aloud,he called which I refused to pick. I was in the room for two good days trying to figure out what next to do, I was confused, shattered,tired and restless. I could not eat. I came out the third day fully prepared for the worst, I was going to tell Shina, I went to our bedroom, packed my clothes, showered and cooked. I was eating when Shina came in, he was surprised to see me and I could not conceal my sadness.
    
    “Baby, what happened?” He asked.
    
    “Just a slight headache,honey” I wanted to tell him about Bola but my tongue was tied. We ate together, and he suggested we see a movie, we sat on the couch but my mind was not there.
    
    I wanted to tell him but I was scared, scared of losing the man I loved, scared of breaking his heart. We sat for hours when we heard a car horned and the gateman opened the door. I was alert. Diamond and Bola came in without knocking, I froze.
    
    “Whoa! Lovely apartment” Amber Rose commented as they took their seat. My heartbeat increased, I wished I could disappear or die.
    
    “What are you doing here, Bola?” Shina asked silently.
    
    “To see my fiancé and his drama queen” she replied grinning.
    
    “I knew trouble was looping around when Dominique came. I knew she was a devil!” He shouted.
    
    “Ayomi, we’ve been together for over fifteen years, why would you leave me for a cheap w---e you met barely two months ago?”
    
    “You know the answer, hoe. Moreover, watch your tongue!”He barked.
    
    ” you left me because I had two abortion while you were away? Ask her if she’s a saint” shina and I exchanged glances.
    
    “Hey miss, this is my woman. I know her quite well, she is not what she claimed she is”
    
    “Shut your mouth, you dummy” I screamed!
    
    “I knew of four times you committed abortions at Kibwas hospital in school, Riri. We met once” she said laughing wickedly. I froze, Shina froze, even the breeze froze. Shina stood up and went into the bedroom.
    
    “Is that all? Are you done? Are you through? Homewrecker!” I barked.
    
    “Oh! This is just the tip of the iceberg. Lowlifer!” She stood up and they left. I knew right there that it was over. I lost Shina, I lost the man who loved me. I went to the room but he had locked himself in the bathroom, so I picked my bag and left. I could not look into his eyes.I knew I betrayed him. I left without a goodbye. The only thing on my mind was suicide. I wanted to be crushed by a running trailer. I left his house that day and went back to my old house.
    
    I got to my former house quite late and everyone in their rooms. I went straight to our caretaker’s room,when he saw the state I am in, he was surprised.
    
    He asked me what went wrong and I opened up to him, I told him what happened and about my fake lifestyle.
    
    I told him my parents are from Ilawe and that they were farmers,he and his wife listened to me keenly and comforted me.
    He told me someone else had occupied my room but the guy was yet to pack in and I could use the room for a week.
    
    I thanked in and went into my former room, they offered me food but I rejected. I retired in bed thinking about my life, I had a rough and fake upbringing. I vowed that night never to lie again even if it was at the point of death. I was in the room for three days doing nothing, I made few suicidal attempts but I was scared, I don’t wanna die. My caretaker and his wife would visit my room occasionally and the wife brought food which I would either eat or reject. On the third day, I heard a knock, I thought it was Fiwa because she called me earlier and promised to check On me the following day. I opened the door and surprisingly it was Diamond, Dummy and Amber Rose, they dragged me out immediately I opened the door.
    They took turn raining insults on me as my neighbours were watching, they told them about my fake life in school, my head was buried in shame.
    
    “I heard you told your neighbours you are working in Access Bank, abeg which of the branches because I’m working in its branch at Bankroad.?” Diamond asked. All my neighbours kept murmuring.
    
    “Alasewo wannabe.” Dummy added.
    
    “Aba me na!” Onome shouted in her native dialect.
    
    “You lied to them you are a banker when you go around servicing men” Amber Rose said. The three of them took turn hiting me and Dummy tore my yellow gown, I was stark naked except the pant and bra I was putiing on. I covered myself with my tattered clothes and then, our caretaker’s wife came to drag me to their apartment. They left when She threatened to call the police. I felt humiliated, I was devasted and my quench for death increased. She advised me to leave our lodge and go and squat with a friend till in able to get over it. I was in her house till evening and when I told everyone would be asleep, I thanked her and on returning to my apartment, everybody was outside, immediately they saw me, they started murmuring, laughing and pointing at me. I buried my head as I walked into my apartment. The following morning around 5am, I was out of our lodge with my boxes, my handbag and my makeup box. I stood at the junction confused about where to go, I sighted an “akoto” bus and immediately I missed my parents. I waved and opted in telling him our street address… ILAWE, here I come.

  <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Episode 8 <br>
    My mom was up already when I got home, she was scared to see me, she left her goods and rushed to me.

    “‘Mòmi, ké è shey o o?” (My child, what happened to you?)She asked in our native dialect. I dropped my bags and hugged her, she was my mother.. She loved me, I remembered those times I was young when she would do everything possible to cater for me. My parents loved Me, I was the apple of their eyes. Even though, I was the only girl and last child, I never lacked anything, I was the only graduate and both of them suffered to see me through. I blamed myself for abandoning them, it was over six month I saw them. I wept as I hugged my mum, I knew she was confused and worried.
    
    “Shey wo loyun ni, ‘mòmi?” (Are you pregnant? My child?) I could not respond, I kept crying. I cried for minutes but I took time narrating my past to my Mother. I apologised for denying her, she cried so much that my heart seized, I knewi was bad, I was trained well but material things took over my heart. My mum urged me to go back to Ado but I told her I wanted to start a new life. She told me people would make best of me if they knew I was back to Ilawe. I told her I would stay for a few weeks before I look for somewhere to relocate to.
    
    I turned a new leaf, I moved closer to God. I brought a new sim and the only contact I saved was that of my parents,siblings, Fiwa and Shina. I woke up everyday with the thought of calling Shina and Fiwa but I believed they were in my past, Fiwa knew my parents’ house in Ilawe and she had not come to see me since I left Ado Ekiti even though my line was not reachable.
    
    Three weeks into my stay in Ilawe, my father came one afternoon and summoned a meeting, my eldest brother, Emanu was there. Emaanu(Emmanuel) was my parents’ first son, he was a semiliterate like my dad because he dropped out of secondary school. He worked as a gateman in FUOYE, Oye Ekiti.
    
    “‘Mòmi, what do you want to do? You can’t continue sitting in this town like this, everyone is making jest of you and us. Will you because a man jilted you ruin your life? You should know by now he doesn’t love you.” I kept quiet. It was true the villagers were making fun of me. I remembered how Akin, my exboyfriend who deflowered me made fun of my predicament.
    
    Akin was the first guy I dated when I was thirteen. I was in JSS3 and he was in SS2 in one of the secondary schools in my village. Akin was Baba Olowo’s son. Baba Olowo was one of the richest cocoa merchant in our village, every cocoa season, Baba Olowo would marry another woman. Akin was his favourite, he was his eldest wife’s last son and he lacked nothing. I was so lucky dating him because he was so proud and hardly made friends with our mates. Anytime I came home for Midterm or holiday break, we would stroll around the village holding hands and we were termed ‘tokotaya'(couples). He deflowered me on my fourteen under a mango tree. Akin dropped out of school that year to look after his father’s business because the man was growing old. I stopped dating him when I gained admission into UNILAG. How would an undergraduate date a dropout? I disgraced him and also embarrassed his mother the day he claimed he came to pay my dowry, who does that? And since then, we had become sworn enemies. I was coming from the market the day he and his mother disgraced me. I was passing through his gate when his mother summoned me to come see her. I entered through the gate. I met Akin and his mother.
    
    “Okun mòmi” his mum greeted,she asked me what I was doing in the village and I told her I came to spend sometime with my parents.
    
    “You think we didn’t hear what happened to you in Ado? Unilag queen” Akin threw at me. I kept quiet
    
    “You refused to marry me because you are a graduate, abi? In jare, ibo lin jasi?(please, what was the outcome)
    “WO o, Akin ti n’iyawo o. Oburin merin li gbesule” (see,akin is married, he married four wives”
    
    “Will you be my fifth wife, I’ll take care of you o… You will be in charge of this house, my work and farm” I was quiet, I started weeping, I felt humiliated. They started laughing.
    
    “Wo fe GBE alákadàlá sule.” (You want to marry a fake lifer) I left the compound crying, I cried all the way home.
    
    “Àbuù mi,you can’t continue staying under our parents. You are the glory of this family and I know you won’t put us to shame. Mòoòmi said you are into makeups”
    “Yes.”
    
    “Baba gave me money to rent a shop for you in Oye Ekiti which I did, I’ve furnished it a little. Come with me to Oye and make money.” He said.
    
    “No, I don’t want to be a makeup artist.” I replied quietly and started sobbing. Shina paid my Makeup tuition and going into makeups would bring back old times. I followed my brother down to Oye Ekiti where I was to start my new phase of life after persuasion from my mother. My studio was situated in the student area and I was able to make lots of customers and had few apprentices
    Kzee, my male apprentice was a 300l Sissy, he walked ,talked and behaved like a female. After makeups sessions or on our free times, we would gist and snap selfies with other apprentices. I wanted to download Jenifa’s diary through his phone one cool afternoon when a call came in. The name that appeared on the screen was “Bro”, it was an international number. I was shocked to see Shina’s picture, I kept staring at the picture till Kzee collected the phone and picked his call. I was starring at him for over ten minutes before he ended the call.
    
    “Riri, abeg why you dey look me that way?” I kept quiet. “Abi you don fall for my brother? See,my brother don marry o” he said grinning, I was shocked,heartbroken and scared, Shina was married. I knew I was close to tears so I picked my bag and went home. Kzee was confused so were others. I cried myself to bed that night. It was a bad day.
    July 12th was my birthday, and 12th of July, 2016 was the best of my years, it was the day my destiny changed,my sadness faded away and a day history
    was made. Mo, one of my students who was into cakes and pastries made me a makeup cake, Ruth decorated the studio with my pics and theirs, Kzee brought me a dress earlier and he said I must wear it for my birthday, I felt happy being around them and my sorrow faded away.
    Around 3pm, a white SUV halted in front of my studio and my parents and brother Emaanu alighted from it. I moved closer to them because I went to visit them that weekend, I was afraid something bad happened and confused because the vehicle was strange. Who was the stranger who brought my parents?
    
    A talk, dark skinned man appeared from the vehicle smiling at me, I fainted!

  <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Episode 9 <br>
    I was in a white-laced dress, Fiwa was adjusting my veil, Amber Rose was applying my makeup, Diamond and Dummy were holding my bouquet and suddenly the groom appeared, it was Shina,I was happy, I was marrying my dream man. I wanted to hug him when his face was replaced by that of Akin. I was scared and looked back, I saw Fiwa, Diamond, Dummy and Amber Rose were staring hard at me, they were all holding daggers, I closed my eyes and screamed, someone held me, I opened my eyes and the first person I saw was Kzee,he was worried, I opened my eyes widely and alas, no white laced dress, no veil, no Fiwa, no dagger, no Akin. I was still in my birthday dress and l was in my bed in my brother’s house, it dawned on me that all was a dream.

    “Sisinlaw, Are you OK?” He asked grinning
    
    “Who is Sisinlaw, are you here to joke right now?” I asked. Then, I saw him, I was not sure it was him but it looked much like him. My love walked into my room followed by his parents. I was confused, I la!d back in and I closed my heart, I slapped my cheeks as I wanted to wake up and face the reality.
    It was Shina, my same Shina… He was with his parents, I was confused, I closed my eyes once again and I heard him ushered out everyone in the room.
    
    “My woman, my woman.” He called out silently. “Ademi, open your eyes, look into my face.” I opened my eyes gently as tears rolled down my cheeks, I adjusted myself as Shina sat close to me.
    
    “I’m sorry, love.” He begged.
    
    “I should be the one to apologise, you did nothing wrong.”
    
    “It was your past, Riri.”
    
    “I fumbled.” I said amidst tears.
    
    “Was that why you ran away?” He asked. “I searched for you.”
    
    “I fumbled, Shina. I was a prostitute, I had several abortions, I was a liar, I was stupid and useless, I don’t deserve you, Shina.”
    
    “Baby, that was your past, we all had a worse past too. I love you not because you are pretty but because you are a great woman. You captivated my soul and my heart feel at peace anytime I’m around you. I met mum and dad and they told me you’ve learnt your lessons.”
    
    “Shina, I aborted six times while Amber Rose had just two! Why would you love me better?”
    
    “You see, Bola was never a woman I loved, she was always forcing herself on me right since we were teenagers. I love you and that’s all that matters.”
    
    “Kzee told me you are married” I asked not wanting to be an option, a second wife.
    
    “He’s right baby, I’m getting married soon” he grinned.
    
    I frowned, I thought he was back to be my man, I started crying. It hurts to lose a man you love. Why would Shina reopen a fresh wound. I was still sobbing when Shina started singing me a birthday song in his best voice, everyone came into the room including my mum whose eyes were filled with tears, they chorused the last verse….”happy birthday to you” when Shina brought out a diamond ring and popped all women’s dream question…. WILL YOU MARRY ME?
    I was shy, I had to bury my head in my palm because Kzee and the girls were hailing me. A lot of things were going through my mind… Was it a dream? What if Shina was here to disgrace me? How about Amber Rose and her girls?
    
    “I’m still on me kneels, my woman. Don’t punish me this far.” He said looking worried. I gently raised my hand and he slipped the ring into it almost immediately. “I love you, honey” he said as he stood up. He hugged me so tight that I cannot help it, it was cool to be in love. Everyone was clapping and hailing us. Our parents went to the living room.
    
    “How were you able to convince your dad down here.” I asked.
    
    “With the help of my mum of course.” “We don’t have time now, darling. Maybe after the party, we can discuss.” He said.
    
    “Which other party, Shina?” I was tired and was not ready for any other birthday party. He smiled at me and left. Kzee and the girl came in few minutes later, Kzee was in a blue agbada and the girls in different styles of the same native attire. Mo handed to me a white lace iron and buba and said Shina said that was my attire for the party. I was confused,who wears iro and buba for a birthday bash nowadays. Before I could say Lack Robinson, the girl dressed me up, cleaned my former makeup and applied another, tied my aso oke and it was wow! I was happy not because of my pretty look but because my apprentices were perfect.
    
    “I don’t understand you guys, this look is a bride’s look o, why will you apply a wedding look for a birthday bash” I corrected professionally. The three of them stood laughing, I was pissed off.
    
    “Riri, it’s a unique birthday for our unique boss” Ruth said.
    
    “Let’s go out now, we’re late already” I said. Kzee was out of the room already.
    
    “The party just started, we’ll go when they call on the celebrant.” Few minutes later, some group of women including my brother’s wife and my caretaker’s wife came in to the room.
    
    “Mummy, what’s happening?” I rushed to meet Mrs Ojo, the caretaker’s wife.
    
    “Congrats my dear!I’m happy it ended well.” She said as she hugged me.
    They ushered me outside my brothers compound to the next compound, what I saw made me turned back. It was my ENGAGEMENT. I saw people decorating that compound when I was leaving for the studio in the morning, I never knew it was because of me. I saw Shina sitting down a the”engagement “seat laughing happily. I smiled, it was my day. My caretaker, Onome, Mama Susan were sitting at one corner waving at me.
    
    I searched around and one person was missing, FIWA. Our plan was that we were going to be together on our wedding day, and she was not here for mine. I knew I wronged her and I would call her after the event.
    
    The event was successful and I was full of joy. My girls stood beside me till the end of the programme. People came from Ilawe, all my client and students of Oye were all present. I was happy, I danced and danced till Shina announced our departure and they took us all, our parents and we, to a nearby hotel. It was actually My Introduction not Engagement.
    I was happy being beside Shina, our wedding was slated for the last Saturday of August, 2016.

    I picked my phone and called Fiwa, she picked.

    “I’ve missed you, girlfriend.” I said immediately she picked my call.
    
    “Who’s that?” She asked harshly.
    
    “Guess.” I replied jokingly. She disconnected the call immediately. I was surprised, I knew quite well that Fiwa could identify my voice in the means of people. Was it because I refused to talk to her for some months?
    
    “Who was that?” Shina asked.
    
    “Fiwa.” I replied.
    
    “Do you still talk to that girl?!”
    
    ” I offended her same way I offended you, she warned me against keeping my past from you but I never listened. I didn’t tell her about my movement since I left Ado and haven’t call till this moment.”
    
    “Ademi, not everyone you make friends with deserve you. Fiwa is not who you should associate yourself with” he warned.
    
    “Excuse me! We’ve been together since primary school. She’s my best friend.”
    
    “Ademi, she almost ruined us, she ruined Dominique and Bola.!”
    
    “I don’t understand you”
    
    “She told me about your fake lifestyle and that you were not the saint you portrayed yourself to be. That was why I was disappointed the first day I made love to you, she told me you had abortions and that was why you were not tight down there so I made love to you to be sure. She was the one who told Bola about us, she described my house to Dominique and gave them your address the day they came to your apartment to embarrass you.” He explained as I listened keenly.
    
    “Ayomi, that is not possible, she is my friend. She didn’t support my past too.” I argued.
    
    “Look here, Ade. She was not happy you met me, she was disappointed in how you could marry a good man despite your bad past. I had our WhatsApp chats here” he showed me their chats, all the negative things she told him about me. I was dumbfounded, Fiwa stabbed me in the back, I wept silently and vowed never to make close friends like Fiwa again. I shared everything with her, I never kept anything from her and she used them against me.
    
    “You should have asked me” I wept silently.
    
    “I thought they were all lies until Bola repeated it” he said.
    
    “I searched everywhere for you, I was sad and was indoor for five days, I love you and want you to be my wife, I went to see my mum who advised I go after you since you love me. In her words,’she saw love in your eyes’.
    She told me you will change and I’m happy Kolade confirmed it to me.”
    Kolade was Kzee’s real name.
    
    .”Are you guys related?”I asked.
    
    “He is my stepbrother, my Father’s lovechild. We were in the states together but Dad told him to come back home because he was associating with the bad gang in Los Angeles. We’re so close since we grew up together.” He said.
    
    “I always feel relaxed around him, I think it is for the kind of bond I share with his brother.” We laughed.
    
    “When I got to your house, they told me you packed out, I went to meet Fiwa, she said you travelled to Abuja with a man, so I withdrew. I went back to the states and that was when Bola called me, she was set up by Fiwa, Fiwa introduced her and Dommy to some guys who after sleeping with them hypnotised them, they shaved their private parts and since then, she was growing lean everyday. She told her parents who took her for deliverance, even though she was delivered, she could not have a child of her own except miracle happened.
    Dommy was presently in Ijare, her hometown . She told me she called to apologized and told me you are in Ilawe Ekiti. It was during this period Kolade used your group picture as his BBM display picture. I was shocked to see you but was happy he said you are a changed person and still single.he told me about your bad mood the day you saw my picture on his phone. My love, here I am for you, and don’t think this time, you are running away.” He narrated and hugged me. I love him, I knew fate brought us together. It was our destiny, I held him tight and sobbed silently. Fiwa betrayed me, I felt pity for Dommy and Amber Rose.
    
    We got married and relocated to the States, my parents were happy that they could boast of me. My wedding was the talk of the town because it was attended by prolific figures and money was wasted. All hotels within and without Ado and Ilawe were filled to the brim. Our villagers especially Akin and his mother came to check if it was true I married a rich man.
    
    Dear readers, we’re married for five months now and I’m looking up to God for the fruit of the womb…. Please pray for me. Fiwa still roams around Ado as no man is ready to marry a devil.
    
    LESSONS
    
    Riri is one of the few who are lucky to get out unhurt even though she learnt her lessons the hardest way…
    
    Girls should say NO to Abortions. It is so rampant this days that we ladies are not afraid to go through the pains of abortions.
    
    Say NO to prostitution. We don’t mind who climbed us all in the name of money and love. Amber Rose and her friends regretted diving into prostitution.
    
    Say No to bad gangs. Some children were brought up in the godly way but the kind of people they associate with destroy their future
    
    Parents should take care of their children well and always check on them as they are growing up especially those in the boarding school.
    
    Parents should detest bad behaviors because children follow the footsteps of their parents.
    
    Finally, Say NO to fake lifestyle. Be yourself and maintain yourself.
