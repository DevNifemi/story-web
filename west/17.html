    Little in life but a decade in experience
	17 felt like the best year for little Micheal swart. Fresh out of high school,with a lady to his name and in the middle of the center of entertainment, surulere!
	The story shouldn't have to start with once upon a time since its the 21st century . 21st century  a decade like no other ,girls and boys having the time of their life not too much of course just a bit of responsibilities in a responsible way. Except the responsibility was too much to handle at 17.	Little Micheal swart only child of Mr and Mrs swart,Micheal named after his father was expected to grow to be a man like his father so he grew and learned pretty much a lot,the good and the bad's. His dad was an electrical engineer at a private firm “Links”, Micheal  was the laboratory prefect at his school “KINGS WILL COLLEGE”.
	Before graduation Micheal the Honcho of the gang already asked Vanessa out,she said yes ! Of course,Hard to resist the charming and intelligent son of Mr Micheal. Vanessa Abel the new student Micheal’s friend Derek was always talking and blushing about unknown to Micheal , Derek already proposed but got turned down, But Micheal little Mr perfect got a yes and a kiss to his name .After graduation Micheal sat for college exam but failed Vanessa went on to further more as she always wanted be a nurse, Distance meant a lot but not the whole world as the they were still young in love and kept in touch at regular intervals.Vanessa already in the first semester of her school life ,got some new friends with few male friend.
	College another world on its own for Vanessa and every fresher, free from home at last ! Mother can’t check if she was having s*x or not. Wasn't too hard for Vanessa to get along with the party schedules ,dance rehearsals  and all sort of illict practice because she was already acquainted with this at her time in high school except this time there was no limit to what she could achieve.
	Micheal having to struggle to sit in for the next exam the following year decided to get a job at a betting company where he worked as a cashier,his parents were unaware of this he had only told them that he is going to volunteer as an assistant computer operator at the computer institute he attended some years back. Some days later Mr Micheal got quarried for trying to alter figures at the firm where he works,after investigations he was found to be guilty and was retrenched with everyone that had a part of the fraud. Unknown to little Micheal and Mrs swart that the Man of the house had lot his job because he kept leaving for work as usual leaves by 8:00am and comes back by 10:00 ,still performing his duties with what he had left in the bank and what he could scavenge from friends around . Mr Micheal too ashamed or proud to inform his wife about the recent changes in his employment status he had ordered for a a full house wife because in his beliefs Mrs swart was too pretty not to get wooed by another man as soon as she starts leaving his house to work for money in another man’s company . As all negative story ends it was over for Mr Micheal he had lost his job and his family. Mrs swart or now Miss Tolani Williams divorced him for failing in his responsibilities as a man and still rejecting her to work ,she had little Micheal at her custody.
	Vanessa just got back from school,looking more matured with new experiences at 17,knowing to her about the situations at Micheal’s house she was careful not to go looking for Micheal at Mr Micheal’s house ,she called Micheal and they meet at their favorite spot .Micheal couldn't help but stare at Vanessa as she looked and acted in a different manner .but she was more loving and eased up as she kissed him as she arrived ,they shared stories to each other and smiled at each other but it wasn't too difficult for her to notice that something was bothering Micheal. He had felt so bad with what had happened with his parents he was doing all sort of things and telling story to listening ears around giving him all sort of advices ,one would come today and tell him how he had bad childhood just like him and told him how marijuana would help ease the pain, it wasn't too hard for him to join up the class as it was nothing new too him but refused the invite of joining a cult ,he was too smart to know that the things attached to being a cult member are too good to be true, that part he left out.
		Vanessa is back, he murmured to himself,he felt better and improved at provoking mother by coming home late as he goes to visit Vanessa as soon as he left work. Best of friends they are and best of lovers as they shared everything together not leaving out s*x ,saneness wouldn't allow him to make use of condoms because she complained she doesn't have a good feeling with condonms Micheal was ready to give all the best feeling as he was new to sex Vanessa had only taught him what she had picked up from college. 
		The holiday break was over, Vanessa had returned back to school and Micheal was back to his old attitude at home,his mum was so depressed having to work so much and still come back to shout at Micheal for doing things he did and things he would do in advance, Micheal felt he couldn't do anything right to please her and he couldn't go back to his father because he uncovered the retrenchment letter issued to his father and was let down by the man he looked up to and felt was in a world where he had to do things by himself,trying all sort of things to have a psychological peace of mind .
	Some weeks later ,he got a call from a strange number that she was around and she needed to meet up ,so they did at their regular spot just this time Vanessa’s mother was part of the meeting.‘so this is the boy that impregnated to you ‘! Vanessa mother shouted as she held Micheal and dragged him toward where Vanessa was sitting . Micheal was expecting a beat down not because he knew he was the one that impregnated her but knew that's how such situations happening instead of that Vanessa mum sat both of them down and tired to know who was really the father of the child .Questions were thrown to both parties with Vanessa answering both question and Micheal shaking his head to them to comply with what Vanessa was saying as he was still in shock.
	The big question in Micheal’s head was how to go home and inform mother about his recent achievement. “mother would kill me “ he said to himself aloud,this time I’ve finally done it ! All hell broke loose of course with Miss Tolani but as every situation would turn out they settled in some sort of way at-least for the time but she refused to take in a child as she suggested for an abortion and got turned down by Vanessa family, she got mad and decided not to take part. Vanessa family agreed to keep the child if Micheal’s family would send in the responsibilities and take part in the up bringing of the baby . Vanessa’s mum called in on several intervals too discuss somethings with Miss tolani but Micheal’s mother wasn’t ready to hear a word of the issue .
	 Micheal still surprised at what had happened ,it all happened to fast ,one second it was about his father loosing his job,then the divorce and now a baby and school was not forth coming his mum was giving him the time of his life with so much words he could take at his age and his father was no where to be found at that time,Micheal had become to harden,no one to converse with to serve as some sort of relief the only one he could talk to was his intended baby mama Vanessa but he couldn't get that much opportunity as her mother picked up the phone all the time . Micheal’s mum had always been insisting for a DNA test but  Micheal already admitted to Vanessa's mum that he impregnated her daughter which was not so sure to him himself and he remembered never
using condoms and most times during sex Vanessa did all the job. “AM I Truly the father of A Child?” he asked himself . Oh ! Lord how did I get into this ? 
If someone had answered the question he asked I guess the answer would have been improper upbringing which was not his fault but the fault of his parents for failing in their duties as husband and wife and as a parent .
	Micheal at 17 with his education on hold and an aspiring father with no parental guidance was the headline of every gist, his friends calling in to check if the gist was true . He was at a point where he never imagined in his life because he felt he had everything under control even if he was irresponsible at some point of his life he felt he still had a goal and knew where he was going but now does dreams have remained only as a dream never to see the light.
