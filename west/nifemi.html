Ayo who got captivated by Nifemi’s (a fellow Christian sister) beauty and gifts and enter into a journey of no return. What is the meaning of A JOURNEY OF NO RETURN? What happened to Ayo at the end? A meticulous reading of this article will answer these questions. Happy reading.

<b> Episode 1 & 2 </b>

(The weekly prayer meeting is going on in a church Auditorium. Sister Nifemi is seen leading the praise worship session. She is a fair and beautiful sister who dresses moderately. She has a good and captivating voice).

Sister Nifemi: ( Sings praises and worship songs) Thou art worthy O Lord!…., Do you know, why I love Jesus… (She changes to praises). This is the day the Lord has made… I will enter His gate…etc

(As Sister Nifemi sings, Bro. Ayo does not sing. He is watching Sister Nifemi with captivating love eyes. He smiles as he claps, nodding in admiration of the beauty of Sister Nifemi in his heart. After some minutes of praise and worship session, the Church pastor dances to the podium holding his Bible. Sister Nifemi gives the microphone to the Pastor with respect and goes to sit among the congregation. Bro. Ayo trails her with his eyes until she gets to her seat.)

Pastor: (He starts the prayers of thanksgiving as a prelude to the word session. Bro. Ayo does not close his eyes, he continues to look towards Sister Nifemi until she gets to her seat. Pastor continues to pray and later brought the meeting to an end).

(In the house of Bro. Ayo discussing with his friend, Bro. Paul).

Bro. Paul: So you were not concentrating on the message and prayer sessions handled by the pastor during the prayer meeting yesterday. I was watching you, your eyes were solely on Sister Nifemi. May God have mercy on you o!

Bro. Ayo: Bro. Paul, you are in the spirit. That is the right prayer point for my present needs. That God should have mercy on me and allow Sister Nifemi to become mine. That Sister has a wonderful, beautiful and captivating voice. She is also beautiful. In fact, my spirit is already telling me that Sister Nifemi is my wife.

Bro. Paul: (Surprised) Ha! Ha! Is it so easy? Are you serious at all? In fact, you are funny. My brother Christian Marriage is not handled the way you are handling it o. you don’t rush into it at all. It calls for thorough waiting on the Lord with prayers and fasting.

Bro. Ayo: (Smiles) you see, Bro. Paul, I have actually prayed on Sister Nifemi. I have been on the prayer for some months now. I only decided not tell anybody. God just gave me a confirmation that she is my wife. The Holy Spirit finally approved it at the prayer meeting yesterday. I only need to go and approach Sister Nifemi without further delay. Yes, it is time to tell her what the Holy Spirit told me that she is my wife.

Bro. Paul: It’s okay. But please look well before you leap. Think deeply before embarking on this journey because Christian Marriage is A JOURNEY OF NO RETURN. Make sure it is God that is truly directing you so that you will not regret it. May God lead you aright in Jesus’ name.

Bro. Ayo: Amen. Thank you. You can also join me in prayer that Sister Nifemi will accept my proposal.

<b> - Episode 2 </b></b>>

(In sister Nifemi’s house, Bro. Ayo is seen seated awaiting sister Nifemi)

Sister Nifemi: (from her room) I will soon join you o Bro. Ayo. (She starts to sing from her room). God is good, He has done me well…(Bro. Ayo is enjoying the voice of Sister Nifemi as he smiles and nod his head in admiration. Sister Nifemi comes in).

Hope you are not annoyed sir? I was doing something in the room.

Bro. Ayo: (with smiles) Annoyed! How can one be annoyed with someone with special beautiful voice and captivating body posture like yours.

Sister Nifemi: Bro. Ayo! You are funny. What are we saying and where are you turning it to. Least I forget, thanks for the gifts you sent to me on my birthday. That was too much o.

Bro. Ayo: There is nothing that is too much for a beautiful one in Christ like you.

Sister Nifemi: There you go again. Well, you said you wanted to see me. Hope it is well.

Bro. Ayo: It is surely well. No problem. It has to do with the Holy Spirit. I have been praying for some time now concerning the person that I will embark on marital journey with. The Holy Spirit has answered me. He says you are the partner I will embark on marital journey with in Christ Jesus.

Sister Nifemi: (surprised) you mean the Holy Spirit said I am your wife?

Bro. Ayo: Yes, thus saith Holy Spirit. In fact, I initially doubted it thinking it was the flesh at work. I then went on seven days fast on the mountain. That was where the Holy Spirit shouted at me saying, ‘Go and tell her now, never delay further because it is from me the Holy Spirit.’ This confirmation made me decided to come and tell you. It was the Holy Spirit that actually directed me to you.

Sister Nifemi: (Talking to herself) Holy Spirit… Me, wife of Bro. Ayo? (She closes her eyes, opens it and look towards Bro. Ayo) I have heard you. You can go now. I will think about your request. I will also take time to pray about it.

Bro. Ayo: (stands) No problem. You too can pray about it but it is an already concluded issue in heaven that you are my wife.

(Bro. Ayo goes out. Sister Nifemi comes in and sits on a chair pondering on Bro. Ayo’s request).

Sister Nifemi: ( Rolls her eyeball and looks towards the sky) Un-un! Holy Spirit…. Me Bro. Ayo’s wife (laughs) Ha! Ha! Ha!

(In pastor’s office, Bro. Ayo and the Pastor having deep conversation)

Bro. Ayo: In short sir, the Holy Spirit told me that Sister Nifemi is my wife.

Pastor: (Holds his breath briefly before talking) Hun-un! Are you sure you actually prayed well on this matter?

Bro. Ayo: Yes sir! In fact, I went on the mountain over this matter. I even went on seven days dry fast because of it.

Pastor: I am asking this question because Christian Marriage calls for prayer and patience. I want you to know that the devil always waits for Christians in the area of choice. And any Christian that misses it martially may not prosper in life and ministry. I implore you to intensify prayers on this sensitive matter. I want you to pray more. In fact, what I am feeling now is that you need to pray more. If after the prayers you are still convinced that Sister Nifemi is the one, you can both come and see me for the next line of action. But please and please pray very well and be sure you receive from God clearly. Peace be unto you. Let us pray.

What happened next? Did Bro. Ayo follow his pastor’s instruction?

After four Months

(Bro. Ayo and Sister Nifemi have just been joined together as husband and wife. The wedding just ended and the couple is seen hand-in-hand in a native uniform attire. They enter Bro. Ayo’s apartment smiling. Sister Nifemi sits on one of the cushion chairs. She is tired. Bro. Ayo draws her to her feet)

Bro. Ayo: (Draws Nifemi to her feet) Beautiful bride, let us offer thanksgiving prayers to God before you retire into the chair.

(Sister Nifemi stands up reluctantly as Bro. Ayo starts to pray)

God, we thank you for the success of this wedding. As we start this new family, God, start with us, build with us……

(As Ayo prays with zeal, Sister Nifemi opens her eyes looking at Bro. Ayo with pity but she says ‘Amen’ aloud intermittently so that Ayo will not notice her nonchalant attitude to prayers).

Sister Nifemi: ( With her eyes opened) Amen!

Bro. Ayo: (Continues to pray) Every power that may want to destroy this marriage shall be consumed by fire in Jesus’ name. (Sister Nifemi did not say ‘Amen’) Help us oh Lord. May we not be put to shame in Jesus’ name.

Sister Nifemi: Amen

Ayo: We thank you because you will embark on this marital journey with us in Jesus’ name.

Nifemi: Amen! Amen!! Amen!!! (Nifemi shouted a deceitful amen)

A week after

(In the house of Ayo and Nifemi, Ayo is seen soliloquizing)

Ayo: I am not comfortable with this strange voice I hear every night since we got wedded. When I wake up to see the person speaking, I always see nobody.

(Nifemi comes in from an outing)

Nifemi: I am back dear! Why are you talking to yourself? Who are you discussing with?

Ayo: Welcome dear. I am ruminating over the strange voice I always hear every night. You said you have never heard it but it is real. I am seriously not comfortable with it.

Nifemi: (Hisses unperturbed) Is that all? I am sure it is the spirit of fear in you that is making you to hear strange voice every night. I want to believe that you need deliverance. You had better open up to the pastor so that he can organize deliverance session for you.

Ayo: Sister Nifemi, this is not the time for jokes. I am serious. I want to suggest that we wake up by midnight today to pray. I know we shall be victorious in Jesus’ name.

Nifemi: (Reluctantly) Amen o. but you will excuse me this night. I am worn out. You can go ahead and take the prayers on our behalf. you are the head and priest of the family. Kindly stand in the gap for us. I want to sleep well tonight. See you later.

(Nifemi walks into the bedroom. Ayo looks at her with surprise as she goes in. Ayo is lost in thought. He later speaks out).

Ayo: Hun-un! Is this the wife I married? But Sister Nifemi was not like this before we married. She loved singing and praying. Kindly hi ish on+2348163633066 to be added to his story platform to read more of this....
But she has relented lately. Hope she is not been influenced by her colleagues at work? May God take control o because I am afraid o. I don’t want to regret this marriage o. Well, I will take the prayers alone and I know victory will come in Jesus’ name. (Ayo also enters the bedroom)

Who or what is responsible for the strange voice? Did Ayo later pray that night and what happened next?
Read on!

EPISODE 4

In Ayo and Nifemi’s bedroom, the couple are sleeping on the bed. Nifemi sleeps putting her legs on the wall beside the bed. A strange sound and voice of women rent the air. It is like some people are holding a night meeting.
OLORI’S VOICE (the head of the group is heard) A JOURNEY OF NO RETURN

Olori’s Voice: I greet you greet members of this cult. You are all welcome

Voice of members: (Chorusely) Ye-e—-es. Ha! Ha!! Ha!!!

(Suddenly, an ANGEL come in, he wakes Ayo. Ayo sees the angel. He wants to scream. The Angel covers his mouth. The angel uses his hand to instruct him to face his wife and listen. Ayo looks towards his wife, He hears a voice. It is the voice of Olori).

Olori’s voice: Hun-un! ‘Burning Pepper’, how far have you gone on your assignment on Ayo your short-time husband?

Nifemi: (Speaks out with eyes closed) Ha! Ha!! Ha!!! I greet you Olori and my colleagues in the cult. As you know, myself and the meat which my trap has gotten, that is Ayo have gone to the altar. We got wedded some months ago. As promised, I will use him as a stepping stone to the downfall of his church. I will render him impotent. I will honour him with sickness. I will turn his business into ashes. Olori and my dear colleagus, it will interest you to know that I have collected the power of prayer from him. In fact, I allow him to go to church occasionally. Presently, I have perfected plans to poison his brain . I am also planning to destroy his properties and then crown it all with AIDS that will send him to the world beyond in our kingdom. I mean hell!! Yes! At least he was the one that said it was the Holy Spirit that showed me to him. Liar! He did not confess that it was my captivating voice and beauty that enticed him. I will render him useless before I kill him.

(Ayo is no longer comfortable with what he is hearing from Nifemi. He wants to shout. He moves towards Nifemi. But the Angel draws him back and gives sign to him not to talk. Fear and sorrow are already written on Ayo’s face. He is sweating profusely. The voice of Olori is heard)

Olori: Well done ‘Burning Pepper’. Be fast with the work because you will soon be sent to another family.

(Ayo still wants to cry out but the angel stops him. The angel takes him back to the bed and signals to him to sleep. Ayo sleeps reluctantly. The angel disappears. Later, Nifemi turns and put her legs on the bed. She opens her eyes, looks round the bedroom, looks at Ayo who pretends if he is sleeping. She adjust herself and sleeps. As she sleeps, Ayo speaks out).Ayo: ( Beats Nifemi on the soulder) Sister Nifemi!!! Ha! So your name is ‘Burning Pepper? So you are not abnormal human being? Ha! It never occurred to me that I married a witch. You are planning to kill me. Ha! God has exposed your evil plans. You will not succeed in these devilish plans on me in Jesus’ name.
Nifemi: (Face Ayo. Her eyeballs change) Hen-hen! So you have heard all that we discussed at the meeting? If that is the case, every intending utterance of the pig stays within the pig. It must not say it out. Therefore, you must not tell anybody what you saw or heard. If you dare tell it to anybody, you will be pronounced dead.

I don’t know why you are now shouting. Were you not the one that received me from God? You said it was during seven days marathon fast on the mountain that the Holy Spirit told you I am your wife. Shameless liar! You know it was not God, but self that took over your senses. You know it was sight deceit. Hen! Continue to enjoy all that are attached to sight deceit. Ha! Ha!! Ha!!! O ya, sleep. You must not forget to keep our secret, secret. Anything that eyes see, mouth must not utter it, or else…!

Ayo: (Stands up and laughs scornfully. He looks at Nifemi with disdain).

You are not serious. Who will keep your secret, secret? No secret. Listen and listen well, I will tell the whole world that you are a witch. Every member of the church will be informed that you are devil's agent. Ha! Your secret is exposed. Witch! Witch!! Witch!!! (He claps on her head mockingly)
Nifemi: Hen-hen! So, you have decided to be broadcasting it abi? Hen! Sebi it is because you can talk. By the time you become dumb, you will know that I am not an easy being.

(Nifemi looks towards the sky, her eye balls change. She looks towards Ayo with the rolling eye balls. She moves near him and talks). The barking of dog cannot be interpreted in words (She touches Ayo’s mouth) let your voice cease. Any utterance of yours will be like a barking dog.

(Ayo tries to talk but instead of utterances, he starts to bark).


Ayo: (Barking like a dog) Gbo! Gbo!! Gbo!!! Hu! Hu!! Hu!!!

Nifemi: (Laughs scornfully) That is good. See, I have just started with you. I did not plan to make you dumb, you caused it. O ya sleep. Good night.

(Ayo sleeps reluctantly. Nifemi is ruminating on the happenings in her hear).

But how did this foolish man know happenings in the cult? It is not possible for any living creature to hear or see what goes on in our meetings or even wake-up during the hours of our meeting. I am surprised. But it served him right. I will show him that I am ‘Burning Pepper’

(Ayo too is ruminating on the happenings in his heart)

Ayo: (Ruminating inwardly) I am finished! I am in soup. Ha! Who am I going to cry to? God, save me! Ha! I am in trouble.

        (In Ayo and Nifemi’s house. Ayo is
        seen prostrating for Nifemi to
        please return his voice)
        Nifemi: It is not a difficult matter, if
        you can promise not to tell
        anybody, I will loose you. I also
        know it is a shame for my husband
        to be barking like a dog. But I don’t
        want you to frustrate my plans. Will
        you keep our secret, secret?
        Ayo: (He nods in affirmation and
        also prostrates for Nifemi)
        Nifemi: Okay, move near me.
        (Ayo runs toward Nifemi. She
        touches his mouth and speaks) Let
        your voice be restored! O ya speak
        out!
        Ayo: ( He speaks out) Ha! Thank
        you! Thank you. ( He jumps for joy
        and wants to run out of the room).
        Nifemi: Come here. Here me and
        hear me right. Now that your voice
        is restored, you must never tell
        anybody. Let our secret, be secret
        or else you are playing with
        premature death. Do you
        understand?
        Ayo: ( Like an imbecile and
        reluctantly) Ye-es!
        Nifemi: That is good. Now, let us
        sleep. At least you need to show
        that you are the husband. So, the
        bride is waiting for the groom’s
        action. Let’s sleep! (Ayo joins her
        on the bed but fear is written all
        over his face).
        Ayo: (He does not know when he
        speaks out) Ha! I am finished!
        Nifemi: What did you just say?
        Ayo: I did not say anything.
        Nifemi: You had better not talk. O
        ya! The jolly husband, come and
        sleep with your ‘Holy Spirit’
        revealed wife. (She moves closer to
        him on the bed)
        
        The next day
        
        ( In Ayo and Nifemi’s bedroom Ayo
        is still sleeping. Nifemi who has
        already woken up comes in to wake
        Ayo)
        Nifemi: Ha! Ah! Our daddy! You are
        still sleeping! O ya wake up and
        lead us in the family altar. ‘Shebi’
        you are the head of the family.
        (Ayo rises from bed and prays
        panicking)
        Ayo: ( He prays. Nifemi later speaks
        out)
        Nifemi: See, let your heart be at
        rest. I have decided not to kill you.
        I don’t want people to start
        suspecting me. I don’t want your
        family to think that I am a witch or
        am I a witch?
        Ayo: (Reluctantly) No o! You are not
        a witch.
        Nifemi: But listen, I will henceforth
        be the husband while you will be
        the wife. I will be performing every
        duty of the husband except for the
        time of sexual intercourse. All
        duties of the wife shall be
        performed by you except for the
        time of pregnancy, labour and
        delivery which will be performed by
        me or you don’t want me to bear
        children for you?
        (Ayo does not answer)
        You did not answer me! Well, that is
        your own cup of tea. Thank God we
        have been joined together in holy
        matrimony. And it has been written
        that those that God has joined
        together, let no man put asunder.
        There is no divorce in Christian
        marriage. Well, I will like to take
        beans and fried plantain for my
        breakfast. Therefore, arise and go to
        the kitchen for food preparation.
        (Ayo stands reluctantly. He walks
        towards the door. Nifemi speaks)
        Ayo, sorry, my husband, don’t forget
        our agreement. No communication
        with third parties. Keep our secret,
        secret. Okay?

Ayo enters the visitor’s room)

Ayo: Mummy, you are welcome. How is daddy? Hope everyone is doing fine?

Ayo’s mother: My husband! The one that throws wealth around in recognition of abundance. The son of the unbeatable lion. The one that abhors ideas in his heart at the expense of gold. We are all fine. Thank you.

Ayo: Mummy! You and this your praise names. We are called by Jesus’ praise name and not idolatry praise name again. I am not the son of a lion which is an ordinary animal but I am related with Jesus, who is the Lion of Judah.

Ayo’s mother: I am only reciting the praise names of your forefather. Well, just help me thank your wife. She has been very accommodating. She has been taking care of me lavishly since my arrival.

See, thank your stars for marrying your mother as your wife.

(Nifemi come in)

Nifemi: Hope you enjoyed the food ma? (she faces Ayo) Dear, your own food is in the bedroom, let Mama eat her own food.

Ayo’s mother: Thank you my wife, I really enjoyed the food. In fact, I am already filled to the brim. It is my son that will use you to the last.

You will bear all the children in your womb for my son.

Anybody that attempts to separate you will be struck down by thunder.

Nifemi: Amen!

Ayo: Mama, what has thunder got to do with this matter? A child of God never curses.

Ayo’s mother: I am not cursing. I am only praying. Well, I need to be on my way back to the village before the sun sets.

I pray once again that no Jupiter will succeed in separating you by the power of my ancestors. Thank you

(Ayo’s mother rises to leave. Nifemi rushes to her and takes her bag and luggage in order to accompany her out. Ayo gives his mother transport fare,

Thank you my husband! May your purse never run dry in the name of my ancestors.

Nifemi: (faces Ayo) Dear, I want to accompany mama to the motor park. You can go ahead and take your leave). (She turns back and uses her hands and eyes to speak to Ayo to go back to the kitchen if he does not want trouble)

Nifemi
my deceitful wife episode 8

(In Pastor’s office)

Ayo: pastor, that is the fire burning in my bosom. She warned me not to tell anybody. She said if I dare tell any human being, I will die. May be I will die anytime from now, I don’t know. But pastor, help me. Please pray for me.

Pastor: Hun-un! This is serious! If not that I heard this story from you, I wouldn’t have believed it. No wonder! No wonder you no longer attend church services regularly. It has been long since sister Nifemi attended singing practice. The choir master reported her absence to me few weeks ago. Hun-un! You mean Sister Nifemi the sister with that wonderful voice and a fervent prayer warrior can be doing all these!

Ayo: Will I lie against my wife? Sir, sister Nifemi is a pretender. She is a deceit.

Devil in the house and angel outside that is Nifemi for you. In fact, when I vowed to tell the whole word, she just seized my voice that I became dumb for a whole day. I was barking like a dog. I had to prostrate and beg her before she loosed me. She goes to her cult meeting every night and I must not talk if I don’t want trouble. Ha! There are other countless acts of Nifemi that cannot be mentioned now. I want you to even separate us. I need a divorce. I am tired of this marriage. I want to call it quit now. Please, assist in breaking this unholy marriage. I am tired of it.
Pastor: I am surprised by what is happening in your family bro Ayo. But, it has been written that thosec that God has joined together must not be separated by anybody. We have joined the two of you together in holy matrimony that was witnessed by heaven and earth.

You only need to intensify prayers that God should touch her and make her turn over a new leaf.

Ayo:

Ha! Pastor. This matter is beyond prayers. The home is hot on me. Please deliever me. Please separate us!

Pastor: Hun-un! Okay! You can be separated if you can do something. Just one thing.

Ayo: What is that thing? Say it. There is nothing you want me to do that I will not do. Just say it and it will be done without delay.

Pastor: if you can do all within your power to see everybody that witnessed your joining without anyone of them missing. The people (both young and old) must witness your separation ceremony, then we can conveniently separate the tvbwo of you.

Ayo: Pastor! You too know that , that is not possible! Some of the people that attended our wedding are dead already. Some of them are no longer in this country. What of those that were friends to our parents and relative whom we don’t know? How do we contact them? Pastor, let us be frank with ourselves, it is not possible.

Pastor: That means it will be impossible to separate the two of you because anyone that witnessed the joining must also witness the separation

Ayo: Pastor! Pastor! Help me. What should I do now? Don’t allow me to die like this. Please, don’t allow me to continue in this marital journey.

Pastor: you must move forward in this journey because you were both joined together in a holy matrimony. Christian marriage does not give room for separation or divorce. You will continue to pray. You cannot divorce her. That is your own cross. Can you recollect that I asked you then, and you said it was the Holy Spirit that told you that Sister Nifemi is your wife. Kindly hi omeano ish on+233544142683 to be added to his story platform to read more of this...
When I went further to persuade you to pray more, you said you have just concluded a seven-day marathon prayer on the mountain where the Holy Spirit gave you a confirmation that she is your wife. But, Bro Peter, before God and man, tell me the truth, was it the Holy Spirit that really led you to Sister Nifemi?

Ayo: En-hen! It was not the Holy Spirit. I was infatuated by her gift and beauty. Now, I am regretting my action.

Pastor: You know I always tell you that you need to pray serious prayers as regards choice. You have forgotten the word of God that says “ Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain; but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.” (Proverbs 31: 30). Well, you will continue to endure it. You have allowed sight deceit to destroy your marital life. The prayer band will be praying for you. There is no divorce in Christian marriage. Just continue to pray may be God will touch her heart.
Ayo: Ha! I’m finished! I have allowed gift and beauty to deceived me into unholy marriage.
