              <div class="collapsible-body"><span>EPISODE 1 <br>

                Tonia was a beautiful girl from a respectable Christian home. She lived a life that pleased God right from her childhood, she was always cautious of her lifestyle, she was still a virgin at 23.
                
                It’s been over 2 years since she left home for college to study medicine. Her mother’s last words to her before she left were “Tonia my daughter, live a life that would please God and keep yourself till marriage and don’t let any man take your pride away”. These words were her backbone and strength whenever she thought of slaking.
                
                Tonia kept herself all through year 1-2, but the story changed when she met Eric in her 3rd year. It was raining on that fateful day and she was stuck in class, waiting for the rain to stop before embarking on her journey home. While waiting, there was a restaurant opposite her class and Eric was seated with his friends eating and drinking.
                
                Eric was from an influential and rich family. He was known in school for living a lavish lifestyle and for also being a chronic womaniser. He was very handsome and girls fell in love for his enchanting charisma. He was the dream of every girl in school and beyond.
                
                As she waited for the rain to stop but it didn’t, she got into the rain, hastening her steps so she could get to her destination faster. Not minding her foot steps, she slipped on a slippery ground and fell drastically.
                
                Eric who was seated with his friends at the restaurant, quickly sighted her and ran to her aid. On getting there, Tonia was bleeding on her head so they had to quickly put her in his car and drove to a nearby hospital around their school.
                
                On getting to the hospital, she was admitted and Eric had to wait till she recovered since he didn’t know any family or friend or hers to contact. Around 5pm in the evening, Tonia opened her eyes to the sight of Eric.
                
                
                “Hey are you ok” he asked, “yeah I’m fine” she replied, please what happened and where am I?” She continued, “You fell so hard and was unconscious, so I had to rush you to the hospital” he said. “How much is the bill” she asked, “Don’t worry, it’s already cleared” he assured.
                
                Tonia thanked Eric for being a lifesaver and prepared to leave for her apartment. “I can give you a ride if you don’t mind” he said, “you have done much already and I wouldn’t want to stress you any further” she replied. “Ok take care” he said and left the hospital.
                
                As at that time, Tonia didn’t know who Eric was and what he was known for. She finally got home, took her bath and slept. The next day, Tonia had a test to write so she hurriedly did some revision before leaving for school. While at school, she looked out to see if she would catch a sight of the kind man that helped her yesterday. “I don’t even know his name” she said to herself.
                
                After the test, Tonia who was known to be a brilliant student, finished up early and left the hall. She was on her way home when she spotted Eric smoking with his friends at a hidden corner in the school.
                
                She was a bit shocked and hastened her steps so as to pass them unnoticed. “Hey!” She heard from a far, and quickly turned to see who it was. Eric had already sighted her and started walking closer. “Hi” she said calmly, “You are the girl from yesterday right?” He asked, “yes I am” she replied. “Hope you are ok now?” He continued, “I’m good” she replied. “Ok take care” he said and was about to leave and she stopped him by asking “please what’s your name?”, “I’m Eric and you” he asked, “I’m Tonia” she replied.
                
                As the atmosphere started becoming awkward, she broke the silence by asking him “do you know that smokers are liable to die young?”, Eric paused for a minute and then replied “yes I know but I don’t smoke all the time”. “But why do you smoke at all?” She asked and Eric gave her an amused look and finally replied by saying “Smoking gives me a kind of joy nobody can”. Tonia was a bit short of words and smiled before finally saying “you haven’t tried everyone, and I pray someday you find someone that would give you the kind of joy smoking can’t beat”.
                
                As Tonia walked away, Eric stood there dumbfounded as he watched her leave. “Who’s this girl? Why haven’t I seen her around school before? She isn’t smitten or intimidated by me” he thought to himself. As Eric walked back to his crew, he wasn’t interested in the weed they were smoking anymore as he couldn’t get his mind off Tonia. He kept asking himself “Who is this girl?”

              <div class="collapsible-body"><span>EPISODE 2 <br>
                Eric couldn’t get his mind off Tonia as he thought of her all through the remaining hours of that day. They were so many questions seeking answers in Eric’s mind. He was lost in thoughts as he kept thinking of his earlier conversation with Tonia.
                
                After a while, one of his friends noticed his sudden change in attitude and asked him what the problem was. “Guy what’s wrong with you lately” his friend asked, “I don’t know man, it’s just that girl from the other day that we rushed to the hospital” Eric replied. “What about her?” His friend continued, “I don’t know, I’m right here thinking about why I’m thinking about her” he replied. ” O boy! Are you sure you aren’t in love already, oga womaniser! You no dey take eye see woman” his friend said laughing, “She’s just different guy, I want to see her again” he said in low tone.
                
                As their conversation continued, Eric pleaded with his friend to help investigate on everything concerning Tonia and get back to him. His friend wasted no time in providing vital information about her.
                
                One fateful day, Tonia was on her way back from church when she sighted Eric in his car, parked opposite the fellowship building. She was surprised to see him. “Hi” she greeted, “how have you been?” He replied, “I have been good, it’s good to see you without a cigarette today” she said smiling, “shots fired” he said smiling too. <br>
                
                Eric asked if she would like to go on a dinner date with him but she turned down the offer. “I haven’t gone out on a date with any guy before and wouldn’t start now” she replied, “it’s just a date and it’s harmless” he said in a convincing tone. <br>
                
                After much persuasion, Tonia agreed to go on a date with him. Eric came to her apartment to pick her up after an hour and they went to a nice restaurant afterwards. “Are you sure this place isn’t too expensive” she asked, “no it’s fine, I’ve got this” he assured. <br>
                
                As they ate, Eric couldn’t stop staring at Tonia. He finally broke the silence by asking “Are you always this reserved and calm?”, “That’s my lifestyle so I guess Yes” she replied calmly. “Do you go to church often” she asked, “To be very honest with you, I can’t remember when last I went to church” he replied with his head bowed down. “I don’t think God loves me, I sure know I’m not one of his favourites” he continued. “Don’t say that, he loves us all and died for each and everyone of us because he loved us individually. He didn’t die for us because we were numerous, even if you were the only sinner on earth, he would have still died for you” she said. <br>
                
                As Tonia spoke, Eric’s eyes were just fixed on her in awe. “Where have she been all my life” he thought to himself. He couldn’t get her off his mind and he was smitten by her choice of words as she spoke. <br>
                
                
                After they were done eating, Eric drove her home and left afterwards. As he drove home, he couldn’t get Tonia off his mind as she was driving him crazy. “Could I be in love?” He asked himself but couldn’t get any answer yet. <br>
                
                The next day, Eric got a text message from Tonia, inviting him for a program in her church. Eric wasted no time in accepting her offer and started getting prepared to attend the program. <br>
                
                The day of the program came and Eric walked into the service when praise and worship was going on. Tonia was in the choir and Eric immediately sighted her singing, the sweet melody that proceeded from Tonia’s mouth sent cold reactions all over his body. He wasn’t concentrating in the worship going on as his attention was on Tonia. <br>
                
                After service, Eric waited for her at the parking lot so he could take her home. The sight of Tonia walking towards his car made him smile. “You were so great back there and also u've got nice voice by the way” he complimented, “awwwwn, that’s so nice of you” she replied blushing. “I’m waiting so I can drop you at your destination” he said, “Ok thanks, please just hold on let me go and get my bag” she replied as she rushed inside to get her bag. <br>
                
                Eric at this point was convinced that he was in love with Tonia. He totally lost interest in every other girl on campus as Tonia was the only one he thought of day and night. He was so scared to tell Tonia how he felt because he didn’t want her to start avoiding him. After much deliberation, he summoned up the courage to pour his heart out to her. <br>
                
                As Tonia returned, they both entered the car and left. As Eric was deliberating on how to tell Tonia how he felt, she asked “how do you feel now knowing that God loves you?”, Eric paused for a moment and said “I feel blessed”. <br>
                
                As he got to her destination, Tonia was about to open the door when he stopped her. “There’s something I want to tell you” he said, “Ok go ahead” she replied looking into his eyes. “I’m scared to say it because I don’t want to loose you” he continued, “you are already getting me scared with the way you’re acting” she replied. <br>
                
                Eric finally summoned the courage and said “Tonia I think I have fallen in love with you”. <br>

              <div class="collapsible-body"><span>EPISODE 3 <br>
                Eric’s heartfelt confession to Tonia gave her goosebumps and she was mute for over 2 minutes. This was the first time a guy has outrightly confessed his love to her. She wasn’t used to the outburst of emotions she was feeling at that moment. <br>

“Please say something” Eric pleaded, “I’m sorry I have to go” she said as she got down from his car and walked into her house. Eric was so devastated as this was the first time in his life a lady turned him down. <br>

Eric went home and fell into deep thoughts, same with Tonia. They both thought of each other but Eric did more of the thinking. Tonia thought of the advice her mum gave to her and made up her mind to stay away from Eric but there was this part of her that wanted him. She tried all she could to fight it but couldn’t. <br>

The next day, Tonia was on her way to school when she bumped into Eric. “Tonia please can we talk?” He asked, “No, I’m in a hurry” she replied. “It would only take a minute I promise” he said and she obliged to his request. <br>

“Tonia I know I’m not your ideal man, I know I have lived a bad life, I know I’m not in your world, but you are driving me crazy. I could be better and I want to be better for you, you are just the right person I need in my life, please just think about it, I love you Tonia” he said. <br>

Tonia’s heart at this point was beating faster like never before. She didn’t know what to say as she was numb. “Eric I can’t date you because I might not give you the kind of things you are used to” she said, “I can adjust Tonia, as far as I have you I’m ok” he said. “That’s what you would say now but complain later, please I have to go” she said as she walked away. <br>

Eric stood there almost in tears and finally summoned up the strength to walk to his car. While in class, Tonia thought of Eric all through. “Should I give him a chance? I also like him” She thought to herself. <br>

After class, Tonia’s lecturer informed her that she would help in marking some scripts in her office. She was there till evening and finally left around passed 6pm. On her way home, she thought of Eric and picked up her phone to call him. “Hi” she greeted, “hey Tonia” he replied in a low tone. “Are you ok” she asked, “yeah I’m fine, where are you?” He asked, “I’m just leaving school, I’m on my way home” she replied. “Can I come pick you up, I’m around school now” he said, “Ok sure” she replied. <br>


She waited for him around the school gate and he was there in no time. There was silence in the car for a while then Eric broke it by asking how her day went. “I have been thinking about our earlier conversation” she said, “Tonia please let me into your life, I want you to change me to who you want me to be, I’m willing and ready to go down this road with you, you don’t know what you are doing to me” he said almost in tears. <br>

After much thought, she agreed to give him a trial. “I like you too Eric and I want to give us a chance” she said. Eric’s joy knew no bound as he was so happy and couldn’t control it. He quickly drove to a nice restaurant and they ate, laughed and got to know each other better. <br>

Eric loved Tonia and wasted no time flaunting her for the world to see. He stopped some bad habits and started going to church more often. For over 3 months, their relationship was going smoothly without any issue until one rainy night. <br>

Tonia visited Eric and after cooking together, they ate and talked till evening. As Tonia was about leaving, the clouds opened and there was a heavy downpour of rain. Tonia had to stay back as she couldn’t go due to the rain. Eric joking said “We can still enter this rain and run to my car so I can drop you off”, “Nahh It’s Ok” she said. <br>

Eric gave her his clothes to wear and they talked and laughed for a while before Eric reached out to cuddle her. As they cuddled, Tonia’s heart started beating 3× faster. “I love you Tonia, thanks for coming into my life” he said, “I love you too” she replied. <br>

Eric kissed her on the forehead, then on her lips. This sent cold reactions all over Tonia’s body as she kissed him back. Eric was trying to be careful not to do too much but the atmosphere was already charged up. Eric reached for her neck and kissed it, then to her shoulders. Tonia died and woke up, as she has never felt this way before. She reached out for Eric’s forehead and kissed it as his lips were on her neck. <br>

Gasping for breath Tonia held Eric’s head and looked into his eyes and said “I can’t do this”. Eric who was already in cloud 9 asked “why?”, Then she replied “I’m still a virgin!”. <br>

                <div class="collapsible-body"><span>EPISODE 4 <br>
                    Tonia’s virginity reveal came as a shock to Eric, as he never would have thought a lady at that age would still be one. He immediately redrew himself from her body and stared at her with a mixed feeling of both excitement and shock. <br>

“Are you serious?” He asked in a surprised tone, “Yes I am” she replied. “Tonia I’m so sorry for coming this far, I didn’t mean to” he pleaded, “No it’s ok, it’s not like it wasn’t consensual” she said. “Do you want to stay or we can still make it to your place now” he asked. Tonia thought for a while and told him it’s best she remained at his place, as it was already late for her to go.
<br>

Eric kissed her forehead and promised to wait until she was ready, even if it meant till they got married. Tonia was astonished by how Eric maturely handled the whole situation and there and then, she knew he was worth waiting for. <br>

“I want you to be my first and only” she said in a low tone. Eric pretended as though he didn’t hear what she said and asked her to repeat herself again. “I want you to be my first and only” she repeated, “Baby I don’t think we should” Eric replied. “I have waited all my life for this day and there’s no other person I would want but you” she confidently said, looking into Eric’s eyes. “Are you sure you want this?, I do love you and feel same way but I can still wait if you want me to” he said, “Today is the day” she replied. <br>

Eric reached out for her lips and kissed it gently, “I would make today a memorable one for you” Eric said as he laid her back on the <br>

The rain seemed to be in sync with them as it wasn’t showing any sign of stopping soon. Eric gently took her clothes off and kissed her whole body like his life depended on it. He gently caressed her and squeezed her soft skin. Eric gave her the ride of her life to a wonderland of ecstasy. He made everything just about her and not himself. Tonia screamed in excitement and called his name over again, squeezing the pillows as she bit her lips.

As the whole atmosphere was charged up, Eric went to his wardrobe and brought out a box that contained protections he used during his playboy days. He picked one and walked back to where Tonia laid. “I want you to open this” he requested, “Why me?” She asked. “I want to have your final consent” he said, “if you open it by yourself, I would know you truly want this” he continued as he handed the protection to Tonia. She paused for a while and finally opened it. <br>

Eric gave Tonia a night to remember and he made sure her first experience was worth it. They slept afterwards, cuddling each other. <br>


The next day, Eric woke up and found out that Tonia wasn’t next to him. He walked to the living room only to find her crying bitterly. “What’s wrong?” He asked but she gave no response. “You are getting me scared, please what’s the problem?” He asked, but she gave no response again. <br>

As Eric was getting frustrated, Tonia got up and walked out on him. Eric tried to grab her hand but she knocked his hands off. “Just stay away from me” she shouted as she left his house, “What have I done?” He thought to himself. <br>

Eric was loosing his mind trying to figure out what he did wrong but couldn’t get any reasonable answer as to why Tonia was angry with him. On the other hand, Tonia got home and burst into tears. “What have I done? God probably hates me and would never forgive me” she said as she cried. <br>

Tonia didn’t go to school or attend fellowship for over one week. She locked herself up and turned off her phones, she didn’t want to see anyone. Tonia cried and almost fell sick. <br>

Eric was restless all through and visited Tonia over 100 times but couldn’t access or see her. Eric was going crazy and regretted ever taking Tonia’s virginity. Tonia’s pastor and church members were worried and came looking for her but couldn’t access or see her too. She locked the doors and didn’t answer anyone that knocked. <br>

“God hates me!” She said repeatedly, “My mum would be so disappointed, who am I? She continued. <br>

After about a week of being indoors, she picked up her phone and called her mum. “Hello mama” she greeted sobbing, “How are you my daughter, I have been calling your line since yesterday but it isn’t going through” her mum said. “I’m so sorry mum” She said in a shaky voice. “Are you ok my darling?” Her mum asked. <br>

She paused for a while and said “I have something to tell you mama, please don’t hate me”. Her mum already started sensing what the problem might be and asked “What is it?”. Tonia finally said “Mum, I have lost my virginity”.</span></div>

                <div class="collapsible-body"><span>EPISODE 5 <br>
                    As Tonia broke the unfortunate news to her mum, there was silence at the other end of the line. Her mum had an emotionally melt down and couldn’t utter any word to Tonia who kept enquiring if she was still active. <br>

“Mum are you still there? Please say something” she pleaded, “Tonia why? why didn’t you wait a little longer till you got married? After all I did to make sure you grew up serving God, why did you choose to repay me this way?” Her mum said in a sad tone. <br>

Tonia felt more disappointed in herself as her mum’s words worsened the whole situation. “I don’t have anything to say to you as this is between you and God” her mum said and cut the call. Tonia fell into deeper thoughts and cried more. “What should I do Lord? Are you still there? Do you still love me?” She thought to herself. <br>

The next day, she summoned up courage to go to class as she had missed alot. On her way to school, she bumped into Eric. “Can we talk” he pleaded, “No!” She replied. “What’s the matter with you? What have I done to deserve this torture from you?” He asked almost tearing up, but Tonia paid no attention as she walked away. <br>

Eric was so pissed and immediately entered his car, banged the door and speedingly drove off, leaving his friends behind. He was later traced by his friends to a bar, where he was drunk to stupor. They tried to take him home but he refused to go. <br>

“Guy why are you doing this to yourself” they asked, “you all should go and leave me alone” he replied almost in tears. “I told you not to fall deep for that babe but you paid deaf ears and now just look at you” his friend said. Eric couldn’t talk further as he kept sobbing. “I love her, she’s the first girl I’ve ever truly loved and now she doesn’t even want to see me” he said as he sobbed. His friends pitied him and carried him to his car and drove to his house. <br>

After about a week of being sober and not having access to Tonia, Eric returned to his old ways and this time around, it was worse than before. His womanising increased and he became emotionless.
<br>

Eric stayed back late in club houses and always returned with multiple ladies. He moved from his old house to a bigger apartment where the big boys in school lived. He had no mercy for his parents money as he doubled his lavish lifestyle. <br>

At this time, Tonia had healed a bit and started missing Eric. She felt bad for how she handled the whole virginity saga and felt she owed Erica an apology. “I miss him and it was foolish and childish of me to behave the way I did” she thought to herself. <br>

After much deliberation, she picked up her phone to call Eric but his line was not available. She tried to call his other line but same thing. It hasn’t come to her knowledge yet that Eric had changed his lines. She tried visiting him at his house but he had moved out. <br>

Tonia started panicking at this point as she didn’t have any clue of what was going on. She searched for him in every familiar place she knew he’d be but couldn’t find him. At this point, Tonia was loosing her mind and didn’t know what else to do. <br>

“I can’t lose Eric, I love him” she said as tears flowed down her eyes. She was walking back home after a fruitless search when she bumped into one of Eric’s friends. “Hey Daniel, how have you been?” She greeted, “I have been good” he replied in an unexcited tone. “Please I have been looking for Eric but can’t find him, do you have any idea where he is?” She asked, “Tonia, I honestly shouldn’t be talking to you after what you did to Eric” he replied. “What did I do?” She asked, “He was loosing his mind, always seen with alcohol, couldn’t think straight, all because of how you left him hanging” he said. <br>

It was there and then that it occurred to Tonia, how much damage she had caused. “Please can I just see him?” She pleaded, “I’m on my way to his house now, let’s go together” he said. Tonia was so happy knowing that she would see Eric in no time. <br>

As they arrived at Eric’s house, Tonia was made to wait in the living room as his friend went to inform Eric that she was there. Daniel walked into Eric’s room to the sight of two girls lying on Eric’s bed with him. He didn’t know how to inform Eric that Tonia was waiting in the living room.

“Hey Daniel my man what’s up?” Eric greeted, “guy can I talk to you alone?” Daniel requested. “Guy please say what you want to say here, I’m preoccupied” Eric said laughing. Daniel finally summoned up courage and said “Tonia is in the living room”.

                    The news that Tonia was waiting in the living room hit Eric so hard that he had to tell Daniel to repeat himself. He didn’t want to believe that the only girl he ever loved, whom he was trying so hard to forget was seated in his parlor. <br>

“How did she know my house, who brought her here?” He asked in anger, “I did” Daniel replied. “Why didn’t you tell me first” Eric enquired, “It was impromptu, she saw me in school and apparently, she has been looking for you so I had no option than to bring her here” Daniel replied. <br>

Eric was so confused and didn’t know how to face Tonia or have anything to say to her. “Tell her to leave” he said raging, “Just try and see her so you hear what she has to say” Daniel pleaded. <br>

After much persuasion, Eric obliged to see Tonia. He warned the girls in his room to remain there and not step their feet in the living room. His heart couldn’t stop beating fast, as he walked down the corridor that led to the living room. <br>

At the sight of Tonia, Eric’s heart dropped and he tried his best not to show any emotions. Tonia on the other hand, couldn’t control her heart beat too, as it was beating uncontrollably.

“Hi” she greeted, “Hey” he replied and sat on a different couch. “You moved, why?” She enquired, “Nothing” he replied. “Ok, so how have you been?” She asked, “Good” he replied. <br>

Tonia was getting frustrated with Eric’s mode of communication as she was the only one asking questions. “Please can we talk about us?” She asked, “There’s nothing to talk about” he replied. Tonia could sense that Eric didn’t want to talk to her and wasn’t excited to see her either. <br>

“Eric I’m so sorry for how I treated you, I know I was childish, I know I could have done better with how I handled everything, it wasn’t your fault and I’m so sorry for cutting you off for such a long time” she said. Eric was mute for over 2 minutes and finally said “It’s all good”. “So where does this leaves us? Are we still an item?” She asked. Eric looked into her eyes and finally said “I can’t find you in my heart anymore, I think it’s time you leave” he said as he got up from where he sat. <br>

Tonia was feeling so devastated and her heart was bleeding. “Oh My! I don’t want to lose Eric, I do love him, I have to tell him” she thought to herself. As Tonia got up from where she sat and was about telling Eric how much she loved him and didn’t want to lose him, those two girls walked through the corridor. One of them gave Eric a peck and they both bid their goodbyes as they left his house. <br>

Tonia was shocked beyond words, she looked at Eric who was mute. “Wow! So glad to see how much I meant to you that you couldn’t even wait a little while before you replaced me” she said as tears rolled down her eyes. Eric at this point was touched and wanted to tell her how much he was going crazy about her and how those girls meant nothing to him, but he was rather mute. <br>

“I’m gone and just so you know, I really loved you” she said as she walked away. Eric was so furious and immediately pounced on Daniel. “why did you let those girls come inside the parlour when you knew fully well that Tonia was there” he said, vibrating in anger. “I tried to stop them but they said they had to leave, that you were taking too long” Daniel said. <br>


Eric angrily wore his clothes, entered his car and drove off to a party he was invited earlier to. While at the party, so many ladies identified him and came to chill with him. He tried every possible means to get his mind occupied so he wouldn’t have to think of the incident that occurred at this house. The more he tried to get his mind off Tonia, the more he thought about her. Eric was going crazy as he couldn’t get Tonia off his mind all through the party. <br>

On the other hand, Tonia cried all through her way home. She was heart broken for the first time in her life. She couldn’t believe Eric could replace her so fast. It broke her heart the more knowing that he took her virginity. “am I ever going to get over him?” She asked herself. <br>

Tonia tried to move on, same with Eric but it seemed so difficult for them. After about a week, Tonia had a project to work on with a male course mate so she stayed back after class till evening. After the project, they walked home together as they lived close to each other. <br>

Eric sighted Tonia walking home with him and raged with an intense feeling of jealousy. “Why do I care?” He asked himself and tried to ignore them but couldn’t. He walked to them and excused Tonia from the guy she was walking with. “Can I talk to you?” He requested, Tonia looked into his eyes and her heart skipped a beat, “Ok” she replied. “Can we seat in my car?” He asked, “Ok” she coldly replied. <br>

They got inside the car and there was silence. Eric kept staring at Tonia, whose head was faced down. “I was going crazy because you didn’t want to talk to me, I tried to hold on but the more I did, the more I fell apart. I had no other option than to go back to the things that could fill in the gap you left opened. You are the first girl I have ever truly loved. You broke my heart” he said with teary eyes. Tonia couldn’t hold it as she broke down crying. “Why did you have to go back to your old lifestyle? I was scared when I saw those girls in your house” she said as she cried. <br>

“You have to decide which life you want and stick to it. I want you to change because you sincerely want to and not because of me, with that way, you’ll be able to stick to your decision even if I turned out to be a bad role model someday. I love you probably more than you love me, because I seek for the salvation of your soul and want you to be a better person” she said as she opened the door and got down. <br>

Eric was deeply touched. “Where are you going to?” he asked in a low tone, “I’m going for Vigil later this night so I need to leave” she replied as she closed the door. <br>

As Tonia got home, she immediately dressed and prepared for the night Vigil that would be holding in her church. As she got to church, she joined the choir to rehearse the song they would sing. Unknown to her, Eric came and was seated in a corner at the back. <br>

Service began and Tonia sang a particular song that made her cry. Eric was so touched and started tearing up. The pastor called for those that wanted to give their lives to Christ. Tonia was still deep in worship and didn’t notice that Eric was kneeling in front of the altar. <br>

As she was done singing, she laid on the floor and broke into tears silently praying for Eric in her heart. They pastor asked those that came out to repeat the salvation prayer after him. Tonia kept hearing a familiar voice. “It can’t be him” she told herself. <br>

As the voice persisted, she finally got up to clear her doubts and Lo and Behold, It was Eric!

                    Last episode!

Tonia couldn’t believe her eyes when she saw Eric kneeling at the altar. She was surprised and very happy. Her joy knew no bound as it couldn’t be contented. Eric was about to make one of the biggest decision in his life and she was so happy to be present. <br>

“Oh thank you Lord! you are indeed mysterious in your ways” she silently said as she got up from where she laid and went back to the choir stand. After the pastor was done with the salvation prayer, he welcomed the new converts to their new family in Christ and dismissed them to their seats. Tonia kept smiling all through the service, she couldn’t wait to see Eric afterwards. <br>

After service Eric stayed back on his seat and bent his head downwards. He was reflecting on his past life and all the wrongs he did. He couldn’t believe that God could love someone like him. He was so grateful and suddenly felt a big burden lift from his spirit. “I feel whole and different” he thought to himself. <br>

As Eric was still on sober reflection, Tonia walked up to him and touched his shoulder. “Are you ok?” She asked looking into his eyes, “I have never been more ok in my life” he replied. Tonia couldn’t help it but smile and beckoned on him to stand up so they could go home as it was already passed 5am. <br>

On their way home, Tonia kept thinking about giving Eric a second chance but didn’t know how to start the conversation. They finally arrived at Tonia’s house and Eric turned off the car. “Tonia can we talk before you leave?” He asked, “Yes we can” she replied. <br>

Eric took a deep breath and said “Thank you for loving me sincerely when no one did. Thank you for showing me the way that led to light when you found me in darkness. I bless the day I met you and want you back in my life. I don’t know what tomorrow holds but I promise to never let go of your hands again. For the first time in my life, I’m sure of what I want and that is You!” He said almost tearing up. <br>

Tonia was so emotional at this moment. She looked at Eric and said “You are my treasure, I couldn’t have wanted anyone else but you. You showed me a different dimension of God’s love I never thought existed. I used to think that God’s love was conditional but my journey with you has made me realise that even at my worst, God still remains faithful”. <br>

Eric held her hands and said “I’m sorry for taking your virginity, I could have stopped you even though you wanted it”. Tonia smiled and looked into Eric’s eyes. She couldn’t stop the tears flowing down her eyes. <br>

“I might not be a virgin physically but I choose to consider myself a virgin in Christ. He has washed my sins away and have accepted me again as his bride. I’m holy and pleasing in his sight and I have chosen to keep myself till I’m finally joined with the man that would take God’s place as the bridegroom” Tonia said in tears. <br>


Eric was dumbfounded as he stared at Tonia. He kept wondering what manner of rare human she was. “It would be an honour for me to make you my wife someday and I’m willing to wait till our wedding night before I touch you again” he said looking into Tonia’s eyes. <br>

After their intimate conversation, Tonia alighted from Eric’s car and bid him goodbye. She entered her house and knelt down to thank God for all that has happened. She slept like a baby all night, knowing that she was back together with the only man she ever loved, same with Eric. <br>

Days turned to months and months turned to years. Eric was done with his degree program while Tonia still had a year left. On the day of Eric’s graduation, Tonia was present and was so happy seeing him graduate in flying colours. He bagged a second class upper and unknown to Tonia, he had already planned with the organisers to give a speech. <br>

As the graduation ceremony went on, Eric was called upon and he walked down to the pulpit. After he was done snapping picture with the Rector, he collected the mic to give his speech. <br>

“I was lost and no one cared to find me until you came along. Words would fail me today if I want to start listing everything I’m thankful for. I’m a graduate with good grades today because of three people; God, good lecturers and you “Tonia”. I love you and that’s why I’m asking you before all these people to marry me. Would you marry me?” Eric said as he knelt down. <br>

Tonia almost collapsed as she couldn’t believe her eyes. “OMG! I could die from this shock” she said as she walked down to the pulpit. Everyone in the hall kept clapping as she walked. <br>

She got to where Eric was kneeling, stared into his eyes, smiled and said “Yesssss!” <br>
