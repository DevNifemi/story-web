                Some few days ago i got a message from a very fair, fine woman on one of the social media platforms. I wouldn't want to mention her name for security reasons, so that all this guys won't go hunting for her.

                She probably ended up going through my Pictures and profile, and asked me to tell her about myself. I gladly did. I told her about myself, my ambitions and my dreams.
                
                Fine and fair women will not kill me answer. Topic brought topic, milk mixed with Garri, sugar became tangerine, one thing led to another and we exchanged phone numbers immediately.
                
                Few minutes later, my phone rang and i ran heading for my phone. Like a dog expecting to be fed by his master, i grabbed onto my phone and picked the call.
                
                "Hello honey " a sweet voice that sounded like cinderalla's own spoke.
                
                " Hello " i replied.
                
                " Am sure you don't know who is talking ko?. "
                
                " Yes please who is talking. "
                
                " Its your love. Halima. "
                
                The name Halima shot a bullet in my head. An unmeasurable amount joy filled up my heart.
                
                " Hajiya Halima." I shouted in surprise.
                
                " Ei... My love Plaises." She replied in her Hausa intonation. " plaises can you come over to my house now. I wan to see your handsome face gaskiya. "
                
                " Okay hajiya. Send me your address. Am on my way. But you will pay my transport back home o. Hajiya i have broke.
                
                " Kai plaises. How much is tlansport. Please enter okada and come. I have already bought you a car wanlai. If you come, you will dlive home with it. "
                
                A pound of laughter landed my face like a boxer's blow. I smiled as i ended the call. Pronto i got into my trouser and shirt and in few minutes i was in Hajiya Halima's house.
                
                The house was as big as a government house. Her high tall gate was made of the hardest of metal rods. They had no security. That house was just impenetrable for criminals. It was electrically enhanced. One touch on the gate could roast you in seconds.
                
                As i approached the gate, it opened slowly on its own.
                
                " Chaiii Electric gate o.. " i shouted to myself.
                
                I walked through the gate and could see the amount of camera that was placed around the compound. My eyes beheld over fifteen camera placed at different angles. Thirteen flashy cars, different models and colours were packed at different angles of the house.
                
                Hajiya Halima ran outside and landed a hug on my body. Her soft breast caressed my chest as she pressed hard on my chest in a warm embrace.
                
                " Plaises. Welcome. Ayaaaa... You look stressed. "
                
                I nodded my head in agreement. As i kept looking and feeding my eyes.
                
                " Don't worry ko. when you are going back home, you will just pick one of the cars and drive home. Hope you can drive?" She asked.
                
                " Ahh, Hajiya , even if i cannot drive home i will push the car home. I must not drive it . " i replied.
                
                Hajiya Halima chuckled. We both walked into the house and Hajiya took me straight to her bedroom. That bedroom was a true definition of a master bedroom.
                
                Two camera's was placed at two angles of the house. Six small sized televisions, obviously connected to the camera, which showed all angles of the other rooms including the gate and stair case, was neatly arranged on a table. A big sized bed; the biggest i have ever seen in my life was placed at the center of the room. Hajiya Halima is a millionaire; a complete walking bag of money.
                
                " please sit down on the bed " Hajiya instructed.
                
                It was while i settled to seat on the bed that i sighted three big Ghana must go bags.
                
                " Hajiya what is inside there?" I asked.
                
                " O my dear... That is money. Thirty million naira in each bag. The other one is empty. My husband Dangote usually drops bags of money any how. "
                
                " You mean your husband is Dangote? " i asked in surprise.
                
                " Yes. My name is Halima . Am the fourth wife of Aliko Dangote. "
                
                My eyes opened. My jaws dropped. Everything in my body erected. My father, my father. Is this how you chose to bless me? See connections.
                
                " Pull your cloths and quickly make love to me. " Hajiya instructed.
                
                It was at that moment that i realized that rich people do not take corners to get what they want. No gist, no cutting conners, they simply go straight to the main target.
                
                It wasn't like Hajiya was sexy o. It was the bag of money i saw, and the car she promised me that was working. Money has a magical way of making you naked even when you don't want to be.ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
                
                In seconds i stripped off my cloths and was Stack naked in front of her. Hajiya was removing her ijab, when her eyes went straight to the small T.V and she sighted her husband Dangote walking into the house. He was walking up the stairs with two huge men who looked like body guards, and three army officers holding Ak 47.
                
                " Plaises! Plaises o... My husband is coming. " Hajiya announced fearfully.
                
                I was struggling to wear back my trouser but i couldn't find the legs anymore. Okay let me wear shirt and the shirt was no where to be found either.
                
                " No time plaises . no time. Enter this Ghana must go quickly. " she said pointing to the empty Ghana must go.
                
                " Ah , why must it be ghana must go? Let me enter and hide in the bathroom naaa. "
                
                " Shut up." She shouted. " My husband may use the bathroom. "
                
                " Okay what of wardrobe. ?" I asked.
                
                " No. He may want to change his cloth. Just enter the Ghana must go fast. He is coming he will not near the bag. If he catch you, he will kill you o " she warned.
                
                That was how a matured man like me, with all my beards and swag entered Ghana must go, carrying my shirt and trousers in my hands.
                
                Hajiya zipped it up quickly. And i bent down stack naked In the bag, just like a criminal.
                
                That day, i cried to God silently. I prayed in different languages. I was praying and sweating profusely. " If you save me lord , i will serve you all my life. I will never follow Hajiya anymore. " i prayed in a whisper.
                
                The door finally opened, and Dangote walked into the house. Hajiya welcomed her husband warmly. I heard other footsteps in the house too.
                
                " Yowaaaa. Security carry this three bags of money to the central bank. Make sure the bank cashiers count the money perfectly."
                
                Just like a sack of rice, i was lifted up from the ground and carried all the way to the booth of the car. The booth was shut close, the car zoomed off and after a long drive, it finally came to a halt again.
                
                I was lifted out of the bag and was now swaying from one side to another. Soon i was dropped back on the floor. That was when i realized that i was now in the central bank.
                
                The first bag was opened, and after some minutes, the second bag was zipped opened. At this point i began to think about my life.
                
                I was suppose to live Hajiya house in a brand new car, but i left inside a Ghana must go bag. I didn't even leave with my cloths on, i left stack naked. " God is this how i will do? Is this how my carrier will finish?" I asked, still sweating like a boiled turkey.
                
                My bag was about to be zipped open when a cold hand tapped my laps, jolting me up from sleep. It was Ebuka my shop neighbor.
                
                " O boy wake up customer de find you. Na which kind Afternoon Malaria sleep be this one? For this hot afternoon you come de sleep for shop. "
                
                I slowly opened my eyes to behold a fair tall woman standing in front of me. Her jib was packed outside the shop.
                
                " Good afternoon sir. Sorry to disturb your sleep. My name is Halima..."
                
                " Halima Dangote ? " i asked , pointing at her in surprise.
                
                " Yes sir, how did you know sir? "
                
                " Madam how i take know no concern you. Just de go. " i fired at her.
                
                " But i want to buy... "
                
                " Madam i no de sell. Just de go. I don't have what you want. This is how it all started before i entered Ghana must go in the dream... Madam the go before you land me in central bank."
