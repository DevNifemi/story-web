                        Rainer:I need some massage from you, follow me to my room(The lady walked slowly after him, when they got inside the room, Rainer shut the door, he sat on the bed and said)I want you to suck my Dick right now, and if you refuse to do that, Consider you and your family Dead, So bend down now,loose my trouser, bring out the fucking dick of mine and suck it, am not requesting am ordering you to suck my Dick now.....

    Amir:I guess we are done for this meeting, I have to go back to my room(He stood up and went out immediately)

    Queen:Erina right?
    Erina:Yes your Majesty!
    Queen: Actually you are really beautiful, so beautiful
    Erina:Oh thank you so much ma
    Queen:What happened is that We need few ladies in the palace ever since the princes came back, firstly they are both strict and hard to understand, I had to sent some maids away because they kept on fraustrating those ladies, and they harrased them in a very bad way, we spent up to a month on that issue just to plead to the family of those ladies, My sons are really hard, so annoying, I just need a very polite, quite and kind lady, I am waiting for the other lady but i was told that she is not around, You don't have two works in this house, Just the two princes are your work, anytime they call you just make sure you go to thier flat, they may need food, they may decide to ask you to clean the rooms and not the cleaners, you just have to do every single thing they want, but mind you, if anyone of them harrased you, please don't hesitate to tell me, I don't know why I choose you and the other lady, my spirit just want youg both, Please and please, make sure you take good care of them, they have thier cooks, cleaners, those who massage for them and everything, but the problem is that they may decide not to ask them to work, they may want you, You and the other lady are just an assistants to the other maids, She is definitely coming next month, till then, make sure you do your job Perfectly, and don't forget that I said when they are trying to be crazy, or they are too strict for you, or harassing you in anyway, please and please, inform me immediately, am also sure that they won't try that again cause the one they did last is enough to teach them some lessons, Do you understand me Erina?
    Erina:(smile)I understand everything ma, and I really appreciate it that you choose me, every person that are out there all wish to serve in the royal house, and here I am, why won't I work very well, i have to do it very well cause this is an opportunity some people are still looking for, Thank you so much My Queen
    Queen:Love the way you speak, You are welcome my dear (Both smile)
    
    Rainer and Amir sat down in the living room to discuss...
    Amir:So you are going in two days now
    Rainer:Your Dad won't allow me, so I was like it's a friend's birthday in USA, he doesn't want me to go, so I told him that you are here, there Is no way I will leave this palace without you, that was when he released my passport for me
    Amir:Your Dad will be thinking that he is wise with Everything, if we want to get the passport on our own now we can't get it right, is that what he is thinking, It's just because we don't want to, he should stop playing so wise, anyway have you book your flight?

    Austin:Am sorry I don't,No I don't princess, Escuze me!(He stood up and moved away from her,He carried her in a bridal style to her bed,he bowed to her and went out of the room leaving her in a biggest surprise)
    
    Rainer was in his room, he was putting his clothes inside his bag, he was getting ready for his travelling, someone knocked at his door while he asked the person to come in, it was one of the maids, Her name is Helen, she has spent five years working in the palace, she is a senior to some workers in the palace and also a junior to few workers, she is the only one who always answer Rainer willingly anytime he called her for sex, She came in smilling, she locked the door while he removed her uniform, She was left with bra and pant, Rainer made a smirk and said...
    Rainer:Do you know who you are flirting with right now (she moved closer to him, bitting her lips, touching his chest, she said)
    Helen:Of course I know, But am sure you want this right now! (Using his hand to touch her boobs, she dragged Rainer's two hands to her her buttocks, making him to press it slowly, she gave out a soft moan, Rainer pushed her to the bed, making her to raise up her ass,she quickly removed her pant, Rainer removed his top, revealing all his tattoos, he loose his trouser, he brought out his dick while he pushed it in her, Helen gave out a little screaming which Rainer covered her mouth immediately, He move in and out of her slowly, suddenly he became more faster and faster and faster, still covering her mouth while he fucked her so hard...

      Queen:Amir keep quiet must you say sorry again?
      Rainer:Oh I guess he doesn't know
      King: Close your mouth
      Amir: Interesting!
      King:If I should move closer to both of you, I promise you that you will regret it(Both of them remained silent)So naughty and rude!
      
      Erina and Ellen sat in thier room discussing as usual...
      Ellen:These guys are extremely something else, how can they be acting this way?
      Erina:They are rude, arrogant, no manners of approaching and many more, honestly I wonder who will date or get marry to them, those ladies lives will surely be miserable cause they won't enjoy them
      Ellen:You are funny, who do you think will fall in love with people like this, I personally just can't, I don't care if they have the money or fame, but these guys are extremely worst, no one will date them, honestly I really do hate them for this, but are we going to do, we are just here to work
      Erina: Honestly I always pity the King and the Queen sometimes, they really look so pity and worried to me
      Ellen: Imagine thier only two sons are not giving them Joy, what do you expect, Can we just close thier chapter and let's talk about something else cause these guys are headache....
      
      Amir asked Erina to sat down, he asked her to watch him while he eat, suddenly Helen came inside, she brought out her tongue to Erina but Erina ignored her, Helen went inside Rainer's room, After Amir was done eating Erina wanted to pack all the plates, but Amir said...
      Amir:No call the other lady to come and pack it and you must both come back here again (Erina walked out angrily, not to long they both came back but they were surprised to hear Helen screaming and the sound of how Rainer was banging her was very loud, they both feel disgusted at the same time)
      Amir: Don't just stand there like zombies, pack away all those stuffs and stop acting like a virgin here(Both Erina and Ellen felt more disgusted)
      
      Ellen and Erina sat in the kitchen waiting for Helen, not to long she came in sweating, she grabbed a cup of water, Erina said..
      Erina:you must have done a lot of work in the Prince's room, I mean for you to be drinking water like this, the work must be hectic
      Helen:That's not your business
      Ellen:Helen what do you think you are doing, you are wasting your life, you know that I don't talk to you, but I have to say this, do you think the prince will love you because you are giving him your pussy?
      Helen: Escuze me!
      Erina: Escuze you bitch!
      Ellen:Look at me Helen, you are just being use for the prince, the day he will get marry to the one he will love I hope you don't kill yourself that day, this guy is using you and fucking you and you think that he Love you, Love my foot! What if the king or queen catch you one day, what do you think will happen?
      Helen: Wait a minute, are you mermaids insulting me now or what?
      Ellen: Don't you ever call me mermaid again, if you repeat it again I will slap your face, cause right now you are making me to be mad at you
      Helen: Mermaid! Well I just call you that what will yo.... (Immediately Ellen slapped her face Which made Helen to also slapped her back, this made Erina to slap Helen for Ellen, suddenly they both descend on Helen beating her so hard without giving her chance to beat anyone of them....
      
      Helen, Ellen and Erina Knelt down looking down, the King and the Queen on thier seats including the princess...
      Queen:I won't repeat myself,now tell me one good reason why you are fighting in the palace
      Helen:Ehmmm.... It was Ellen who slapped me
      Queen:And why did she slapped you?
      Helen: Actually i....it's b....because I always call them m.... mermaids when they do something to me
      Queen: Mermaids? Why?
      Helen: Because i.... I fou....found them more a.... att... attractive and b... Beautiful than me
      Queen:Oh! Really? Why did you called them mermaids In the kitchen, atleast there must be a reason for you to call them mermaids cause you said you always call them mermaids anytime they do something to you, so what have they done to you?
      Helen:Ma?
      Erina:You heard her and stop lying, my queen I will explained what happened
      Queen:Ok am listening (Helen became more sweat)
      Erina:What happened was that Ellen was advising her not to go to the prince anymore, suddenly she called her mermaid which Ellen warned her not to call her that, but she repeated it so Ellen slapped her
      Queen:If I may know, please can you tell me what she always go there to do, I mean the Prince's flat, beside which of the prince?
      Helen: Nothing ma

      Helen:I.... It's true ma
      Tahera: Haha!
      Queen:I will ask you one more question, is the prince forcing you or you do it willingly?
      Prince:H.... He.. I....i do it willingly
      Queen:Nice,My King, the judgment is in your hand
      King:You allow my son to lay down with you in my palace, Huh? (Helen began to sweat and tears keeps on rolling on her face)I should have punish you but I won't,So Just take your bags and leave this palace That's my final judgement! (The king went in straight while the Queen moved closer to Helen and slapped her so hard)
      
      Amir and Rainer were discussing, while Austin just sat on his phone listening to thier conversation...
      Rainer:So the King sent Helen away because of those two ladies?
      Amir: Honestly!
      Rainer:But you didn't tell me that the queen employed a new maid
      Amir: Thought it's meaningless, that was why I didn't bother to tell you
      Rainer:I still can't believe it that Helen is gone like that, seems those ladies want my attention, and I will surely give it to them.....
      
      Austin came inside Tahera's room, he bowed and said....
      Tahera:Have your seat
      Austin:This will be the last time I will come here, this is not proper (Tahera moved closer to him while she hugged him so tight, waiting for Austin to hug her back but he was only trying to free himself from her, but she wasn't ready to free him, she raised her head up looking at Austin's face , both staring at each other
      Tahera:Kiss me!
      Austin:No I won't do that (still trying to free himself)
      Tahera: Austin please, please just kiss me
      Austin:Can you please stop this, I am not going to kiss you so st... (Suddenly Tahera dragged his head closer to her while she kissed him, Austin was lost to her at that moment, he held her on her waist, suddenly he broke the kiss and said)
      Austin: Please stop, Just stop it please
      Tahera: Austin i love you, please I really do(crying)
      Austin:But I don't, i don't love you don't you get it?
      Tahera: I know you do
      Austin:And I said I don't, Please! (He bowed and went out of the room)
      
      Erina brought in Amir's food, placing it on the table, Both Amir and Rainer came out of the room at the same time, Erina almost freezed...
      Rainer:Why is there one food?
      Erina:Ellen is bringing it(As they were about to sat down, Rainer's phone rang while he went inside his room to receive the call, the moment he entered the room, Ellen brought in the food, they set the dinning, the moment they left Rainer came out of his room after he finished receiving his call....
      
      Amir was fully dressed, he is going to the companies, the cars are ready, he came out with Austin and few guards, he was led in straight to the car while they drove out of the palace....
      
      Ellen was brushing her hair at the front of the mirror, suddenly from the window, she saw a car coming in the palace, a lady came out of the car, she was dressed in short blue dress, silver heels with full make up...
      Ellen:Erina Erina, come come come, come and see something, Who is that?
      Erina:Oh! That's one of the Prince's slut
      Ellen:Oh I see, that guy will never change, I wonder if he doesn't get tired of all these
      Erina: Honestly I don't pray for such husband, The princes are the worst guys on Earth
      Ellen:I saw prince Amir today, he was fully dressed in suit, where did he go to?
      Erina:He will be in charge of the king's companies, while Prince Rainer will take over the throne, So probably he went to check the companies
      Ellen:Oh I see....
      
      The priest came to the palace, he came to discuss with the king and queen...
      King:You said you want to see me, hope no problem?
      Priest:Your Majesty, I think I already found out what will calm the princes
      King:(Happy) Really?
      Priest:Yes my King
      King:And what's that thing?
      Priest:Permit me to say this first, the main reason why I came here is because I had a dream to the prince
      King: Which of the prince?
      Priest:It's prince Rainer my King, I had a dream that the prince made a great mistake which eventually put someone's life into a danger
      King:He made a mistake which put someone's life in danger?
      Priest:Yes my King
      King:And whose life is in danger?
      Priest:His future Queen, You know I told you that what will calm the princes is already in the palace and I think I already know what it is, and that's love
      Queen: Love?
      Priest:Yes my Queen love, the day the princes will fall in love, that day will be the end of thier bad behaviors, but for prince Rainer there is a great danger for his future Queen, the dream was very bad my King,but am sure it won't come to pass,You see My King, what happened is that the moment the prince will set his eyes on his woman, I will repeat myself, The moment the prince Will set his eyes on his woman, he must stop one thing,he must never have anything to do with any other woman again, he may not talk to her yet, he may not do anything to her yet, but as long as he set his eyes on her, the prince must never have anything with any other woman again, and if he should meet his woman one day and he decide to have something with other woman, this can take the live of his future Queen, and he doesn't have two future Queen, just one was given to him before he came to this world, Even when the prince see this woman, he personally will feel it in him that she is the one for him, that woman is in this palace already
      King:In this palace?
      Priest:Yes my King and this is the warning, don't try to find out who the lady is, and don't try to find out anything just sit back and watch, That's all My King! (He bowed)....
      
      Rainer sat with the king and queen...
      Rainer:Are you Joking with me right now, what the fuck are you talking about, Me, love, woman, How, Oh my God I can't believe this shit, you are still trying to force me on how to learn everything about the throne, and now you are telling me about my future Queen, oh no I can't believe this shit is happening to me, am really going crazy right now, you have changed everything about me, how can you be telling me about love, do I even look like someone that will fall in love now, or tomorrow or even in the next fifty years, do I look like I will fall in love, Oh my God! Me? A single woman for me? As cute as I am, Honestly I can't believe this!
      Queen:But we were told that she is here in the palace, maybe you have seen her
      Rainer:Save me that Mum,which of the palace, wait are you trying to tell me now that one of the workers here is my wife, oh no am eventually getting mad,my issue is getting out of hands, honestly there is no way I will fall in love with a low class girl, when there are a lot of influential and pretty ladies in town, infact I need to see your priest, thank God it's a dream, he can just sleep back and have a better dream, just spare me that shit called Love! (He stood up and walked out immediately)
      King:Who do you think, who came to your mind?
      Queen: Honestly my King I have no idea who could that be, I still can't believe that my son's future wife is in this palace working here with us, I really wish to know her as soon as possible....
      
      Rainer explained everything to Amir who was just laughing so hard....
      Amir:Wait you mean your wife is in this palace
      Rainer:Seems you are sick, mine or ours?
      Amir:Of course not mine,They just can't tell me that shit
      Rainer:And they were like I will have the feelings the moment I see her, it was just like am watching a movie, this should be in the movie not in my own life
      Amir:I guess the priest was completely drunk when he came to the palace
      Rainer: Obviously!He is so fucking drunk and crazy
      
      Ellen woke up in the morning, she went to take her shower, she got dressed while she moved to where Erina was sleeping, she touched her body but was surprised to see Erina burning up, she quickly ran to the toilet to get a towel to put inside the water, while she whipped her head, putting the towel on her forehead.....
      
      Austin came in to meet both Amir and Rainer....
      Austin:Your Highness!
      Amir:Where is She?
      Austin:She is sick
      Amir:Ask her to come over here
      Austin:She is sick, infact the doctor came to check on her
      Amir:Oh really?
      Austin:Yes?
      Amir:Call me the second lady
      Austin:Yes! (He bowed and went out, after awhile Rainer went inside his room, not too long Ellen came in,She bowed while Amir said)
      Amir:Your friend is bad right?
      Ellen:Sick!
      Amir:Shut up! Keep quiet, Don't correct me,the reason why I and Rainer are eating your food and also Erina's food is because you both seems to have little sense of dressing than others
      Ellen: Escuze me!
      Amir:D... Did you just tell me that? You are so stupid,You really are,when am talking you don't talk,ask your friend to put some sense in you,are you crazy, Escuze you?To me?I Kno what to do to you, Now get out and get us what to eat(Ellen bowed and went out angrily, Suddenly Rainer came in back to the living room...
      
      Rainer's car drove inside the palace as he was coming down, he saw a lady going inside the palace, he couldn't see her face but her back view, he asked Austin that...
      Rainer:Who is that?
      Austin:Oh that's Erina's friend
      Rainer:You mean the second lady?
      Austin:Yes your Highness!
      Rainer:Oh, she got some great back view(He winked and went in straight while Austin just followed him)
      
      Late at night, Erina woke up...
      Erina:Ellen! Ellen!!
      Ellen:(waking up from her sleep)Yes Erina, what do you want? (Moving closer to her)
      Erina:Ellen please I want a cup of water?
      Ellen:Oh sure, let me get it for you in the kitchen
      Erina: Thanks! (Ellen went out of the room to get the water)
      
      Rainer was outside alone receiving a call, he was busy moving round the compound, suddenly he saw someone's figure in the kitchen through the window, he decided to check who was in the kitchen, so he went inside the palace but before he could get to the kitchen he saw the back view of that person leaving so he went out back....
      
      Rainer was sitting with Amir outside thier flat, suddenly Ellen came inside the compound,she was coming from outside but she wasn't looking up, but Rainer saw her, He expect her to raise up her head but she doesn't do that till she went in straight, Rainer muttered that...
      Rainer:(Silently)Who are you?
      Amir: What?
      Rainer: What?
      Amir:You said something just now
      Rainer:No I wasn't talking to you
      Amir:Are you sure that you are ok
      Rainer: More than you
      Amir:Indeed!...
      
      Rainer was having some problem on his sleep,he couldn't sleep,as he stepped out of the flat coming towards the palace, there was a sign of rain in the sky,He stared at the palace building for some moment,after awhile he went in back his room,the moment he left Ellen came out to have some fresh air, suddenly there was no sign of rain in the sky again,it was all clear....
      
      The king laid down on the bed,so also the queen was with him,both are discussing...
      King:Is Rainer receiving his lecture?
      Queen: Sometimes he agree while Sometimes he doesn't want to,I think we should be happy, atleast he is answering us sometime,still better than none
      King:You are right,Have you notice Amir or Rainer talking to any of our maids yet?
      Queen:Not at all my King,do we need to do that, Remember the priest told us not to verify anything, let's just leave everything to God,Am sure all is well....
      
      Rainer was in his room listening to the news,He could hear Ellen's voice in the living room talking to Amir,but he decided to sat back and not to bother himself to check the owner of the voice...
      
      Amir was about to go out with his guards when he saw Erina coming out,she bowed slowly to him while he said....
      Amir:I can see that you are better now, make sure you come to my flat to check on me when it's exactly four, understood?
      Erina:Yes your Highness!(he made a smirk while he entered the car and drove out of the palace, Erina hissed and went in back angrily)....
      
      Austin and Tahera was at the back of the palace discussing...
      Austin:Tahera please,can we just stop this,ok fine I love you,I really do,Since that's what you want to hear from me,I love you,I really do, But I don't think we can work out
      Tahera:(holding his hands)Of course we can,we can work it all out,just tell me it's ok and you love me,I will sort it out by myself, please Austin,you are all I want,I really love you, please!(Austin was speechless while he stared at her, suddenly he moved closer to her and kissed her)...
      
      Rainer was unable to get a good sleep again, he stood up from his bed and went out of his room, when he got outside, his guards wanted to follow him,he said...
      Rainer: Don't worry am ok, I will just walk round the compound (They all bowed and went back to thier posts, Rainer stood at the front of the palace staring at the whole building for awhile, in his thought he said)
      Rainer:King? Love? Me? I don't think am ready for this! (Suddenly Ellen came out, she was coming from the back of the palace, suddenly both Ellen and Rainer's eyes met, both staring at each other,immediately an heavy rain started to pour, that moment there was a thunder and at the same time was a lightning in the sky.....

        Rainer stood in the rain, so also Ellen, both staring at each other, After awhile, Ellen bowed slowly to him while she went in straight leaving Rainer in the rain, two guards quickly brought an umbrella to cover Rainer while they led him inside....
        When Ellen got inside, she changed her wet clothes into a dry one, many thoughts keep running in her head, she kept on wondering why Rainer would stood in the rain staring at her, she laid down on her bed still thinking about the whole drama in the compound, not too long she slept off...
        Rainer laid down on the bed, he remembered what he told the King and Queen..
        
        FLASHBACK
        Rainer:"Do i even look like I will fall in love, there is no way I will fall in love with a low class girl"
        FLASHBACK END...
        
        Rainer stood up from his bed, he sat on the couch in his room, flashing back the way he saw Ellen, Her face couldn't stop appearing to him,after a long trial to be able to sleep he was able to slept off...
        
        Ellen: Wait what are you talking about, love, I don't love you and I will never love you,You just don't worth the one who will be my husband,you can't win my heart,you can't, there is no way I will fall in love with you cause I hate everything about you,every single thing about you despise me! (suddenly Rainer woke up, it was a dream, he checked his time, it was 10:00 am in the morning, Amir came inside his room sitting on his bed and said)
        Amir:I heard you went out to the compound again yesterday, what are you looking for in the compound so late at night?
        Rainer:Nothing I was just having some fresh air
        Amir:You sure that you are not having another Helen in the palace?
        Rainer: Spare me that, of course am not
        Amir: Something is missing in you these days
        Rainer: Missing, Something is missing, Like what?
        Amir:I really don't know, but you really look so different these days and your attitude seems to be somehow different
        Rainer:There is nothing wrong with me or my attitude, am still me, this is me
        Amir:If you say so....
        
        The priest came to the palace, the king and the queen was on thier seats, including Tahera, the King Said...
        King:You are right, there was a big rain yesterday, and there was a very big thunder, infact I don't know why am feeling like have never experience such thunder before
        Queen:It was so powerful yesterday
        King: Exactly?
        Priest:My King and My Queen, Everything that happened yesterday shows that the heavens are happy and glorified, The heaven have tied both the prince and his future Queen together, because that was the moment they saw eachother in this compound yesterday night
        Queen:(Happy) What? It's a lie, you mean when it was raining yesterday, Both the prince and the woman was staring at each other,So closely?,
        Priest: Exactly My Queen
        King:You can't know how happy I am right now
        Priest:The heavens already tied them, but one thing I want you to do is that, don't ask the prince anything, don't ask him anything please, he will open his mouth by himself to tell you, but I want you to study his behaviors, you will also see that he is a change person, and for prince Amir, his own is also on the way, That's all My King! (He bowed, while the King, queen and Tahera was just surprised in happiness and joy)....
        
        Erina and Ellen sat in thier room discussing...
        Erina: So you mean you and Prince Rainer saw eachother yesterday night?
        Ellen:Yeah, but I don't why he stood there in the rain, He just stood there staring at me, I don't know why, so I just walked in

        Ellen:I think so, yeah! We haven't see each other before, wait can we just forget about that and let's talk about you leaving, can you please stay here with me, please don't leave
        Erina: Honestly Ellen I can't cope with Amir's madness, he is becoming Crazy, I don't think I have any room for patient again, the guy is getting on my nerves, I only told Austin, but tonight I will talk to the Queen that i can't work here again

        Amir:I heard that you are leaving, if I may know, can you please tell me why you are leaving this Damn palace, answer my question, why are you leaving this palace?
        Erina:(She frowned her face)Nothing Your Highness!
        Amir:No reason?
        Erina:Yes!
        Amir:Now let me tell you this,if you leave this palace, if you leave this palace without me releasing you, I promise to fish out every single member in your family, and they will be the one to suffer it, you can just try and leave this palace if you want to, seems you are proofing to be a stubborn brat, I will show you that am still your boss here, so just try and leave this palace, I won't say more than that
        Erina:My family will suffer it if i should leave the palace, On what reason, what have I done?
        Amir:How dare you to question me, how dare you? Common get out of my face, you suck! (Erina ran out with tears on her face)
        
        Rainer sat down listening to his lecture, after some hours the man left, Austin came in and said...
        Austin:The king asked you to come(He stood up while they both went out of the house, He met the King, Queen and Tahera on thier seats, For the first time Rainer prostrated to greet both the King and the queen, everyone was lost, even Austin who was behind him couldn't believe his eye, Rainer doesn't bother to look at the surprise on thier faces, He just sat down staring at the floor waiting for the King to talk.....
        
        Erina and Ellen in the kitchen, Erina's face was different and her eyes are swollen and red..
        Ellen:I can't just believe this, but why is this guy like this, what is your family doing in this issue, you are here to work and since you don't feel like working here anymore I don't think there is a big issue here, or have you met him before, maybe somewhere in town before you came here
        Erina:Of course I haven't, this is where I met him, I met him in this palace, he just choose to make my life a living hell
        Ellen:So if am also going now he will stop me?He will asked me not to go? I can't just believe this...

            Ellen arrived at the hospital, She met her sister Ella in her Dad's ward, her Dad was sleeping while they both sat down staring at thier father...
            Ella:I just can't believe it that our Dad's operation was a successful one, honestly sis am so happy, so happy
            Ellen:Me too,am really happy, but am just thinking about something
            Ella:What's that?
            Ellen:I just wonder why the Prince will pay for my Dad's operation, I mean why would he gave out such amount of money and still he installed foodstuffs and provisions to our home, just why?
            Ella:You are very funny sis, it's nothing, don't you know that as the next king, you have to gain the people's favour and kindness, as a king you have to take care of your people, there is no other reason than that, Am sure he just did it out of caring and kindness
            Ella:I hope so.....
            
            Amir sat down alone in the living room, He flashed back the way he kissed Erina, He was still thinking about Erina when Rainer came in, he sat with him and said....
            Rainer:You are somehow dull these days, what's going on with you?
            Amir:It's Erina
            Rainer:Don't tell me that you are in love with her
            Amir:Maybe or maybe not, am not sure, but that's not my problem right now,This babe is proving to me that she is hard to get, fine am ok with that too,but the funniest part of it is that she said she is not ready to forgive me,Austin talked to her, you won't believe that Tahera also talked to her but she said she is not ready yet, wait was I that bad to her, was i that bad for her to forget everything, she even told me that am out of her league
            Rainer:What?!
            Amir:Am telling you bro, believe me she said that to me,I can't believe it
            Rainer:Come to think of it Harry, you were to harsh on Her then, the way you treated her was extremely bad then, So I guess she is still mad at you, why not give her some more time, don't bother her again, am sure she will let you know when she is ready to forgive you
            Amir:She got some nerves, honestly no one has talked back at me, no Lady have the gut to insult me like the way Erina did to me, and I wonder why I couldn't get mad at her
            Rainer:Amir it's love
            Amir:Love?
            Rainer:I think I just believe what the king and the queen told me, I won't lie to you, I have a lot of feelings the first day I set my eyes on Ellen, I feel it, and I Know it, but even if she is the one, will she ever accept me? that's what baffles me, for the first time in my life, I find it difficult to approach a lady properly and that's Ellen, she made me soft, she made me powerless, I can't believe it that this is what it looks like when you fall in love with the rightful one, Honestly I Know deeply in myself that am in love with Ellen, but I don't know if she really feels the same way, but no matter what I won't let go of that girl, I will take it slowly with her, i won't rush her,with time she will also realize it, so that's why am telling you to leave the girl alone, don't rush, just leave her alone, with time she will turn up......
            
            Amir woke up in the morning, he saw Rainer in the living room, he was on his phone....
            Amir:Where is Austin?
            Rainer:I don't know, I also woke up this morning, I checked him in his room, but he wasn't there
            Amir: Maybe he went to the palace (Amir sat down,the moment he sat down Austin came in with a sad face)
            Rainer: What's going on, why is your face like this, and you woke up so early today, what happened?Austin?
            Amir:Austin is everything ok?Say something
            Austin:T.... The kin.... The King is Dead!
            Rainer:The what? C... Come again, you said what? Answer me, the king is What?
            Austin:T.... The King is Dead! (Tears streamed down rapidly on Amir's face)
            Rainer:(confused)Y... Yo... You are t.... trying to tell me that m....my Dad is dead?
            Austin:Yes your Highness! He was unable to wake up early this morning as usual, so the queen went to his room and realized that the king is Dead
            Rainer:(full of tears)I...I... I Can't believe this, of course he is not dead, maybe he is still sleeping, Huh? Austin maybe he is still sleeping, He can't be dead, he can't, because he can't be dead, because am still yet to proof myself to him, I haven't ask for his forgiveness, I haven't tell him that am a good son now, so don't tell me that he is dead, don't tell me, Don't tell me that! Don't tell me, Austin say something please,Amir you can't be crying cause he is not dead, Austin!!!
            
            Two weeks later after the king was buried, the chiefs and the Queen with the priest sat down in the palace discussing...
            Chief 1:Priest you said Prince Rainer can't be the king until he get marry, but the former King wasn't like that, his Dad wasn't like that, he was a king before he got married to the Queen, so why is his own different?
            Chief 2:And also do you realize that this throne can't be empty like this, we need to crown him as soon as possible, because this is his throne, so why are we delaying everything?
            Priest:I greet you all, the chiefs, My Queen, I greet you all, Chiefs we have to calm down, we can't rush the prince, we need to take it slowly with him, Firstly he is still grieving,we need to give him some time on that, secondly the prince can't be a king without him getting marry first, That's exactly how the Oracle told me,it shows that his own is different from the former King, The Oracle said we should leave the throne alone until the Prince is ready, Infact He can be a King without him getting marry, but on one condition
            Chief 3:What's the condition?
            Priest: That is if he choose to be crown by himself, without anyone telling him or asking him to be the King, he have to say it by himself, without anyone telling him to do it, the prince can be a King without no Force, so let's Leave everything to him, either he gets marry Before we crown him or after we crown him, everything is in his hand, not me, not you, not the Queen, not even the former King can wake up and tell him to be crown, the prince will decide by himself.....
            
            Amir sat in his room, he sat on the bed, He was looking dull and uncheerful, The Queen came in, she sat next to him on the bed while she made him rest his head on her Chest....
            Queen: Amir, it's ok, I know how much you love your Dad, I know, but I want you to cheer up, there are a lot of things you need to do, so just buckle up so that your Dad will be happy with you in heaven, please son (He raised up his head looking at the queen while he held her two hands, he said with tears that)
            Amir:Do you think I was sad because Dad is dead, do you guys think that was the reason, that wasn't the reason, I am just guilty, honestly mum am guilty for everything, how can I make him sad till he died, I was just wondering why I choose to make him sad everyday, with the way he took care of us, I can't believe that I repay him this way, I wonder why I acted that way then, honestly am sorry, am so sorry for myself cause it's too late, how I wish he wake up, just to ask for his forgiveness and tell him that Dad am a good son, Dad am sorry, Dad I promise to make you happy, mum those are the words i wish to tell him right now, those are the words am still yet to tell him, Mum am sorry,Mum am so sorry, am really sorry, Really sorry Mum! I wish I could turn back the hands of time,Am really sorry,just sorry,so sorry,Mum am sorry(He began to shed tears holding the Queen's hand, she couldn't help but to shed tears with him)
            
            Rainer was in the compound,at the back of the palace was the king buried, He stood at the front of the grave staring at it, his two hands in his pockets, he remembered the way he had provoked the King right from the beginning, he remembered Everything, Tears streamed down on his face, he bent down at the front of the grave,He said...
            Rainer:If someone tell me that you are going to leave this way, I will deny it, I still can't believe it that you are gone, I can't believe it that I won't see you again, but why don't you wait a little bit Dad, why don't you give me some time, just to tell you how sorry I am, You did everything for me, you surrendered everything for me, but I gave you nothing, I gave you Stress, Sadness and sorrowful mind,what hurts me most is that you never give up on me till you die and still I never realized that, I know how much I hurt both you and mum,am even scared to take over the throne,Dad am guilty and am scared,I don't know if this is too late,but am sure you can hear me, I have no Escuze, honestly no Escuze,But am sorry,Dad am sorry for everything,For everything am deeply sorry,I....I... wasn't aware of my attitude then,How I wish I say this before you died,how I wish I let you know that have turned a new leaf,how I wish I let you know that am in love with someone,how I wish I spend a good time with you,Dad you gave me everything,I know you did everything for me,but I was ingrate,I was ingrate Dad,am sorry for everything,for been a bad son,for troubling you and Mum,for making you restless,for disgracing you, Dad am sorry for
            everything, Dad am sorry,and am really sorry,I don't think I can do anything without your forgiveness,Dad am sorry,Amir is sorry,I am sorry,Dad we are sorry,We are so sorry!!!!(He continued to shed tears over and over again with the only words that he kept on repeating)I AM SORRY!!!!!

              Tahera:Mum, why are you doing this again, you are not eating regularly, no one wants Dad to leave us this way, but if you continue to act like this what about Amir and Rainer, they need you mum, they really do, you guys should be the one to comfort me, but I was surprised that you are the one doing this, Rainer is coming home late again,Amir refused to leave his room,and you too is like this?Oh please just cheer up, please Mum!I can't take it if all of you break down like this,what about me,think about my feelings too

              Erina:Honestly I can't believe it too
              Ellen:I just can't believe it that the king's death can we break the princes down this way
              Erina:It's all because they never show him respect till he die, it hurts them,I also pity them,They were blindfolded with thier attitude then,it's good that they are now good guys
              Ellen:But Prince Rainer gets drunk and comes home late at night, Well we can't blame him, he is only grieving, after all he stopped this before,if not for the king's death,he won't be doing this,so I don't blame him
              Erina:There was a day I heard the Queen telling Austin to watch after him and never allow any lady to move closer to him at the club, I mean why will the queen said that, after all the Prince is a grown-up guy, He should be able to decide for himself and also this won't be the first time we will see him with Ladies, So why that?
              Ellen: Maybe he is forbidden not to have anything with any lady till he gets to the throne
              Erina:It's possible
              Ellen:And you, when are you planning to forgive prince Amir?
              Erina: Honestly I forgave him already, even before the king died, I just don't have the time to tell him yet
              Ellen:Guess you should let him know now that you forgive him already maybe that will cheer him a bit
              Erina:My forgiveness won't cheer him up
              Ellen:Well, it will cheer him up

                Priest: There is nothing to do about her, she is dead, she got what she wanted, No one is at fault on her death, she stands as a sacrifice to the gods, instead of taking the Prince's woman away, the gods used the other lady as a replacement, as you can also see that everything happened at the same time, The gods just want to use her(Ellen)to teach the prince some lessons, and am sure he learnt his lesson already, We should be at peace, Everything will surely be perfect as long as the prince take the offerings to the Sea
                Prince:Where is She?
                Queen:She is in my room(He paused and said)
                Prince: When and what time am I doing the offerings?
                Priest:12 am
                Amir: Midnight?
                Priest:Yes
                Rainer:Am I to go alone to the sea?
                Priest:I and the other young priests will escort you, but we won't get close to the sea with you, you alone will go to the sea by yourself, and this is the warning, you must not be scared, no matter what you will see or comes your way, you must not get scared (Rainer stood up immediately while everyone all bowed for him, including the Queen and Amir, Rainer just went in straight to the Queen's room, When he got inside, he close the door, he moved closer to her, he sat next to her on the bed, Ellen was in a deep sleep,she was tucked inside the blanket, Rainer went for her hand, He kissed her hand and said)
                Rainer:Am sorry for putting you to this, am deeply sorry for putting you to this situation, am really sorry!(He pecked her forehead and covered her very well, He went out of the room)....
                
                Rainer and the priest together with four young priests are all in white, Rainer was barefooted,he was holding a big white Calabash which contained different kinds of fruits, white boiled eggs and on his left hand was a white dove,The priests stopped at a junction while they asked him to walk alone to the Sea, He was told not to look back till he gets to the sea, when he got there, He dropped it on the floor gently, He knelt down at the front of the Calabash while he prayed silently in his heart, the moment he opened his eyes, he couldn't believe that the Calabash was gone, he released the Dove while it flew to heaven, right in his presence the Dove disappeared, He got up from the floor while he walked away from the Sea.....
                
                Two MONTHS Later.....
                Ellen was with the Queen, She came to see the Queen...
                Queen:Ellen, You have to do this, you also know that there is no other man for you except the King, He loves you and am sure with time you will also fall in love with him, Accept his proposal so that you can both get marry
                Ellen:I just need some time, I really need some time to get through everything, this is not my fault my Queen, it's my heart, I can't just fall in love with the person I barely like, I don't love him, of course he is doing everything for me to love him, but ma honestly am trying, am trying to love him, but it just not working out, and I said maybe I should I should just go to my place for the main time, to go and think about everything
                Queen:But he said that you are not allow to get out of the palace, his word is the final, he is the King, so he is having a full right on Everyone here, I know you still need more time, take your time here, do anything you want here, the king won't allow you to get out of the palace, Please my dear, just give him the chance, just for this wedding, Say yes! Honestly I don't know what's wrong with you and Erina for declining both the King and Amir's request,I know that they were once a bad guys,but can't you see that everything is changed,they are now a changed person
                Ellen:Ma it's not easy, It's just not easy
                Queen: Honestly am confused!(She breathed out, looking so stressed)

                Erina's room was a large room, everywhere was cool and looking nice, she was on the bed, she laid down on the bed, she wasn't sleeping, a maid came in with a cup of coffee, she placed it on the stool beside her bed and left immediately, Erina flashed back her last conversation with Amir..
                
                FLASHBACK
                Amir:What do you want me to do?
                Erina: Nothing, just nothing, I am here to work and not to love, can't you just leave me alone and search for another lady?
                Amir:No! No!! It's you I want and you are mine
                Erina:Am not yours
                Amir:You are mine
                Erina:Am not, and if you want to keep on stressing then I have to leave (He paused and said)
                Amir:Well listen very carefully, Starting from today, your work in this palace is over,And there is no way you will get out of this palace,You are the one I love and I can't just open my eyes seeing you talking to another guy not to talk of getting marry to another guy,you know it and they have told you several times without number that I am the one for you, Erina can't you see that I love you, please, Erina please
                Erina:Prince I don't love you
                Amir:Then you are not getting out of this palace!(He walked away while Erina bent down crying)

                Erina stood up from the bed,she sat down resting her back on a pillow,she drank from her coffee, suddenly Amir came in,Erina ignored him,he sat down on the bed staring at her,after awhile he said...
                Amir: How are you?(She gave him no response)Erina(wanted to touch her but she removed her hand, she placed down the coffee and laid down on the bed backing him, Amir sat there for awhile before he went out of the room)

                Austin:So none of them is saying Yes
                Tahera: Honestly, But sometimes Ellen do come to the compound to have some fresh air, unlike Erina she is always indoor
                Austin:Have you notice both Erina and Ellen talking?
                Tahera:No not yet, but am sure that they are calling eachother
                Austin:I heard that the King gave Ellen four days to decide
                Tahera:Yeah,and the last day is tomorrow
                Austin:We can't blame them, besides they also should know by now that no other guys for them than the King and Prince
                Tahera:Austin it's not easy the way you think of it, We are talking about love here, Ok Fine the King love Ellen so much, Amir also love Erina a lot, but the ladies are not in love with them, this depends on the heart, we can't blame them
                Austin:Have heard you, So what if Ellen is still on her decision till tomorrow?
                Tahera:(she stood up and walked closer to Austin,She sat down with him)Well I don't know, let's just leave everything into the king's hand, he will decide everything tomorrow and for Amir, I think he is trying to wait more for Erina (She hugged Austin Smilling, while Austin pecked her cheek)....

                King Rainer:Young woman what do you want, what do you want me to do?
                Ellen:I said I am not getting marry to you
                King Rainer:And I said you will cause my word is the final, I can't wait anymore, after we get marry am sure your heart will change into a positive way, you should know by now that you are mine, so am getting marry to you in the next four days, that's all!

(He went away, the Queen bowed while Ellen was just shedding tears on her standing, the Queen tried to comfort her)
                
                After King Rainer's wedding with Ellen, Late at night, Ellen was in her night wear, she sat on the bed resting her back on a pillow, she covered her legs with the blanket, Rainer came out of the bathroom,he was putting on his pyjamas, he climbed up on the bed covering his legs, he got himself a pillow while he also rest his back on the pillow, He looked at Ellen who was looking the other side, He said)
                King Rainer:I know that this is not What you want, I know that you are not ready for this, but can't we just try to face the reality now, I and you were strongly made for each other, I can't have another woman and you also can't have another man, is that not enough for you to understand that we are made for each other, Forcing you to get married to me is just to let you know how to fall in love with me like the way I do to you, my thoughts was that maybe after the marriage things can still change between us, maybe from there you will learn how to love me, those are my thoughts, I know how you are feeling right now, and I promise not to do anything against your wish again, but about this wedding I want you to know that this shouldn't be against your wish, this is compulsory, Ellen I love you and I really do, there are a lot of things you changed in me ever since I met you, even if we are not meant to be, honestly without you in my life am meaningless, you make me whole and I can't just afford to loose you, I really love you and I hope you return the love to me also, Please! (After awhile He laid down on the bed facing the roof, not too long he slept off, after awhile Ellen stared at him for awhile then she laid down and slept off too)..
                
                King Rainer and Amir sat alone in the palace discussing, not too long the maids came out of the kitchen serving the food.....
                Amir:How is your wife?
                Rainer:She is still the same, I know that it's difficult for her to believe the truth, I just have to leave her alone, am sure she will realize the whole thing very soon, I even talked to Erina also, we just have to give them some time
                Amir:Yeah exactly, that was why am not rushing Erina too,let's eat your Majesty, the food is ready (They stood up and walked up to the dining,they sat down to eat, suddenly Rainer's phone rang while he stood up to receive it, Amir decided to continue eating till he finish his call, after awhile Rainer came back)
                Rainer: So you decided not to wait for me
                Amir:(He smile)I don't know when you will finish your call and I have something to catch up with in the office
                Rainer: No problem i was only Joking also (As Rainer took his fork and knife to eat, suddenly Amir started to feel some pains in his stomach, not too long he started vomiting blood which he was rushed back inside his room, The doctor arrived to checked on him immediately, Which it was confirmed that he ate poison, all the foods on the dinning was examined and it was confirmed that they were all poisoned, Everyone became worried for Amir,for the first time Erina was also worried for him, The priest was called immediately to the palace, Rainer said)
                Rainer: Whosoever tried to kill me and my Junior brother won't go scot-free, I swear on my father's grave to deal with Whosoever did this, it seems you want to bring out the old Rainer, Priest please do what's right (Immediately a water was placed down, everyone was asked to drink from it, a warning was passed on to them that if anyone knew about the poison should confess,If the person refused to confess and decide to take the water will surely be forced to confess out of pains and die, The older queen was the first to drank from the water, then Ellen, followed by Erina, Tahera, Austin, all the guards, and all the maids,the workers,drivers, the last set of people to drink from the water are the cooks, after the fourth person the fifth person refused to drink the water)
                Priest:Young lady, please drink the water like others, Young lady?
                Queen:Can't you hear him or what's wrong with you Bella?(She began to shed tears, Rainer moved closer to her while everyone bowed and moved back a bit)
                King Rainer:I won't say this twice,Who sent you to kill me and Amir?
                Bella:(crying and stuttering)I.... It... I... Your Majesty am sorry please!

                  Rainer:Why is Erina cooking and not the Ladies?(He heard Ellen's voice immediately)
                  Ellen:She just wanna cook for the prince by herself (Rainer was shocked seeing how stunning Ellen was, She was putting on a smile, She bowed while Rainer remained mute, He stared at her, focusing on her face, suddenly she said)
                  Ellen:Is there a problem your Majesty? (Bringing him back from his whatsoever thought)
                  Rainer: Nothing, Just nothing! (He went out immediately while the guys followed him, Ellen smile while she went inside the kitchen, the maids bowed to her immediately)
                  Ellen:You Ladies can go, Just leave us alone (The ladies bowed once again and went out of the kitchen immediately)Do you want some help?
                  Erina:Of course No, i won't let the king punish me for making you to work
                  Ellen:You are so funny, He was even about to tear down the boys when he saw you cooking
                  Erina:Very funny, Come and help me out with this your Majesty! (She bowed in a funny way while they both laugh)...
                  
                  Amir was on the bed, he sat on the bed watching the TV, He kept on changing the channel, he was bored, he dropped the remote while he grabbed his phone, Suddenly there was a knock at the door, three maids brought in a big tray,they placed it down on the dinning that was in the room, they bowed and left immediately, Erina came in, She was looking sweaty, She came in moving to the dinning, Amir switched on the AC, Erina dished out Amir's food finish and said)
                  Erina: Please come and eat(Amir was surprised for awhile, He stood up and moved closer to her, He sat down while Erina sat with him, Amir still in full surprise, Suddenly Erina said)

                  Rainer came inside the room,He dropped his crown and beads, He realized that Ellen was in the bathroom taking her shower, He stood there doing nothing, lost in an erotic thought, suddenly Ellen came out, she was in a very short yellow towel, She wasn't surprised to see Rainer standing, but he was surprised to see her in the towel, her laps revealing, her back view was taking over him, He felt like hugging her so tight and kissed but he wasn't sure of his courage, Ellen said....
                  Ellen:Is everything ok? (Rainer found it difficult to swallow his own saliva and he found It difficult to answer her)Your Majesty! Your Majesty!!

(Ellen whipped his tears slowly and said)
                  Ellen:At first I was mad at you, for forcing me to this marriage, but I realized it when I got married to you, I started missing you when you are not in the palace, I found myself getting closer to you, To be candid I realized something the day of that Poison, what if you eat the food and died, what's my hope, what's my gain, different kinds of thought in me, It was then I realized how much I also love you, but I was unable to realize it on time that I also love you, at first I was scared about my feelings but i... (Suddenly Rainer kissed her again, He grabbed her waist, pushing her to get more closer to himself, He kissed her neck slowly, straight to her chest, He lifted her up in a bridal style, He dropped her on the bed slowly, He kissed her again loosing the towel, revealing her whole nakedness, Rainer kissed her left nipple, straight to her right nipple, holding her two hands together on the bed with a single hand, he used his other hand all over her body,after awhile he released her hands Kissing her stomach down to her laps, He moved up back to her lips, He said)
                  Rainer:Honestly I feel like sucking you Ellen but I can't do that cause of my position, But still I want to feel your pussy baby, can I? (Rainer had taken over Ellen, she couldn't say anything, all she want is for Rainer to do whatever he wants with her, Rainer kissed her again while he dipped his hand in her wet pussy, She gasped immediately......
